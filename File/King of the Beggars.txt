PREFACE.

THE many incorrect and inelegant editions which have been obtruded
on the public have induced the present Proprietors to undertake a
more complete history of this celebrated man.—Various are the ways
by which the human mind endeavours to mount the ladder of fame,
and an equal ability is displayed by the monarch robed and his
humble subject in tatters.—Peter Pindar says truly,

Condition, circumstance, is not the thing—
Bliss is the same in subject as in king,—

And if we change but little the sentiment, we shall have a perfect
picture of the conditions of mankind. Had fate ordained the
present royal family to humble life, or to till the soil, they
might have shone as honest farmers, and been as much celebrated
for the acres they had tilled, as the revenues they have spent.—If
parallels may be drawn between great and little characters, the
monarchs of the universe are little more than so many Carews, who,
under the idea of state necessity, beg of their subjects. Now,
supposing the superior abilities of Mr. Carew had arisen to their
proper elevation, he might have proved an able negotiator ; and,
possessed of great diplomatic address, would doubtless have
succeeded by stratagem and finesse in whatever he undertook ; but
he chose to be a prince in the little world, and this was much
superior to occupying a humble post in the great world.—If it be
objected that his practice was mean and beggarly, this may
particularly affect his superiors, who are looking up to places
and pensions, and would sacrifice the interest of the country to
batten upon the national loaves and fishes.—Mr. Carew can never be
viewed in any other point than as an active solicitor, and in this
respect he outstripped the most eminent lawyers, for he was always
thankful for what he received. If charity be the readiest path to
bliss, and of this there can be no doubt, Mr. Carew may claim much
on this head, since he set a great deal of this amiable principle
on foot, and often made his occupation the means of punishing the
cold and flinty hearted.—Seriously, however, we hold him up as a
character more remarkable for eccentricity than worthy of
imitation.

THE EDITOR.


Chapter I
His Early Life; Joining the Gypsies


Mr. Bampfylde-Moore Carew was descended from the ancient family of
the Carews, son of the Reverend Mr. Theodore Carew, of the parish
of Brickley, near Tiverton, in the county of Devon; of which
parish he was many years a rector, very much esteemed while
living, and at his death universally lamented. Mr. Carew was born
in the month of July 1693; and never was there known a more
splendid attendance of ladies and gentlemen of the first rank and
quality at any baptism in the west of England, than at his: the
Hon. Hugh Bampfylde, Esq., who afterwards died of an unfortunate
fall from his horse, and the Hon. Major Moore, were both his
illustrious godfathers, both of whose names he bears; who sometime
contending who should be the president, doubtless presaging the
honour that should redound to them from the future actions of our
hero, the affair was determined by throwing up a piece of money,
which was won by Mr. Bampfylde; who upon this account presented a
large piece of plate, whereon was engraved, in large letters,

BAMPFYLDE-MOORE CAREW.

The reverend Mr. Carew had several other children, both sons and
daughters, besides Mr. Carew, all of whom he educated in a tender
and pious manner; and Mr. Carew was at the age of twelve sent to
Tiverton school, where he contracted an intimate acquaintance with
some young gentlemen of the first rank in Somersetshire,
Devonshire, Cornwall, and Dorsetshire.

It has been remarked by great men, that there is a natural
propensity in the mind of a reader to be inquisitive about the
person of the hero whose actions they are reading; and authors in
general have been so sensible of the power of this curiosity, that
it has long been a custom for them to present their readers with
their own pictures in the front of their works, with the design,
doubtless, of pre possessing their readers in favour of them, by
the marks of wisdom and ingenuity in their countenance ; thus, not
to mention any other instances, those two great authors, Mr.
Dilworth and Mr. Dyche, have both indulged the work with their 
pictures before their ingenious spelling books. We cannot but
commend this custom as a very fair and candid one; for what reader
would buy an author, if his countenance declared him a blockhead,
did we not suspect the engraver is so kind to the author as to put
greater marks of wisdom and ingenuity in his countenance, than
nature ever bestowed upon him.

[Note: These two authors acted very candidly in publishing their
pictures while alive, that the world might be enabled to judge of the
skill and impartialitv of the engraver.]

This desire then of being informed of the person of the hero of
whom they are reading is so natural, we should be guilty of a
great neglect, were we to omit satisfying our readers in this
respect, more particularly as we can, without making use of a
figure in rhetoric, (which is of very great service to many
authors,) called amplification; or, in plain English, enlarging,
present our readers with a very amiable picture.

The stature of our hero was tall and majestic, his limbs strong
and well-proportioned, his features regular, his countenance open
and ingenuous, bearing all those characteristical marks which
physiognomists assert denote an honest and good-natured mind; for
which we refer to his portrait.

During the first four years of his continuance at Tiverton school,
his close application to, and delight in his studies, gave his
friends great hopes that he might one day make a good figure in
that honourable profession which his father became so well, and
for which he was designed.

He attained, for his age, a very considerable knowledge in the
Latin and Greek tongues; but soon a new exercise or accomplishment
engaged all his attention; this was that of hunting, in which our
hero soon made a surprising progress; for, besides that agility of
limb and courage requisite for leaping over five-barred gates,
&c., our hero, by indefatigable study and application, added to it
a remarkable cheering halloo to the dogs, of very great service to
the exercise, and which, we believe, was peculiar to himself; and,
besides this, found out a secret, hitherto known but to himself,
of enticing any dog whatever to follow him.

The Tiverton scholars had at this time the command of a fine cry
of hounds, whereby Mr. Carew had frequent opportunity of
gratifying his inclinations in that diversion. It was then that he
entered into a very strict friendship and familiarity with John
Martin, Thomas Coleman, John Escott, and other young gentlemen of
the best rank and fortune.

The wise Spaniards have, we think, a proverb, Tell me who you are
with, and I will tell you what you are; and we ourselves say, That
birds of a feather flock together. It is generally allowed that
proverbs are built upon experience, and contain great truths; and
though at this time very young, he contracted no acquaintance, and
kept no company, but with young gentlemen of birth and fortune,
who were rather superior to himself than beneath him.

It happened that a farmer, living in a county adjacent to
Tiverton, who was a great sportsman, and used to hunt with the
Tiverton scholars, came and acquainted them of a fine deer, which
he had seen with a collar about his neck, in the fields about his 
farm, which he supposed to be the favourite deer of some gentleman
not far off; this was very agreeable news to the Tiverton
scholars, who, with Mr. Carew, John Martin, Thomas Coleman, and
John Escott, at their head, went in a great body to hunt it; this
happened a short time before the harvest. The chase was very hot,
and lasted several hours, and they ran the deer many miles, which
did a great deal of damage to the fields of corn that were then
almost ripe. Upon the death of the deer and examination of the
collar, it was found to belong to Colonel Nutcombe, of the parish
of Clayhanger.

Those farmers and gentlemen that sustained the greatest damage
came to Tiverton, and complained heavily to Mr. Rayner, the
schoolmaster, of the havoc made in their fields, which occasioned
strict enquiry to be made concerning the ringleaders, who, proving
to be our hero and his companions, they were so severely
threatened, that, for fear, they absented themselves from school;
and the next day, happening to go in the evening to Brick-house,
an alehouse, about half a mile from Tiverton, they accidentally
fell into company with a society of Gypsies, who were there
feasting and carousing. This society consisted of seventeen or
eighteen persons of both sexes, who that day met there with a full
purpose of merriment and jollity; and after a plentiful meal upon
fowls, ducks, and other dainty dishes, the flowing cups of
October, cider, &c. went most cheerfully round, and merry songs
and country dances crowned the jovial banquet; in short, so great
an air of freedom, mirth, and pleasure, appeared in this society,
that our youngsters from that time conceived a sudden inclination
to enlist into their company; which, when they communicated to the
Gypsies, they, considering their appearance, behaviour, and
education, regarded as only spoke in jest; but as they tarried
there all night in their company, and continued in the same
resolution the next morning, they were at length induced to
believe them to be serious, and accordingly encouraged them, and
admitted them into their number; the requisite ceremonials being
first gone through, and the proper oaths administered.

The reader may perhaps be surprised at the mention of oaths
administered, and ceremonials used, at the entrance of these young
gentlemen; but his surprise will lessen when we inform him, that
these people are subject to a form of government and laws peculiar
to themselves, and though they have no written laws, by which
means they avoid all perplexity with lawyers, yet they pay
obedience to one who is styled their king; to which great honour
we shall hereafter see our hero arrive, having first proved
himself worthy of it, by a great number of necessary achievements.

There are, perhaps, no people so completely happy as they are, or
enjoy so great a share of liberty. The king is elective by the
whole people, but none are allowed to stand as candidates for that
honour, but such as have been long in their society, and perfectly
studied the nature and institution of it; they must likewise have
given repeated proofs of their personal wisdom, courage and
capacity; this is the better known, as they always keep a public
record or register of all remarkable (either good or bad) actions
performed by any of the society; and they can have no temptation
to make choice of any but the most worthy, as their king has no
titles or lucrative employments to bestow, which might influence
or corrupt their judgment.

The only advantage the king enjoys is, that he is constantly
supplied with whatever is necessary for his maintenance, from the
contributions of his people; whilst he, in return, directs all his
care to the defending and protecting his people from their
enemies, in contriving and planning whatever is most likely to
promote their welfare and happiness, in seeing a due regard paid
to their laws, in registering their memorable actions, and making
a due report of all these things at their general assemblies; so
that, perhaps, at this time, it is amongst these people only that
the office of a king is the same as it was at its first
institution; viz. a father and protector of his people.

The laws of these people are few and simple, but most exactly and
punctually observed; the fundamental of which is, that strong love
and mutual regard for each member in particular, and for the whole
community in general, which is inculcated into them from their
earliest infancy; so that this whole community is connected by
stronger bands of love and harmony, than oftentimes subsist even
in private families under other governments: this naturally
prevents all oppressions, fraud, and over-reachings of one
another, so common amongst other people, and totally extinguishes
that bitter passion of the mind (the source, perhaps, of most of
the other vices) envy; for it is a great and certain truth, that
Love worketh no evil.

Their general meetings at stated times, which all are obliged to
be present at, is a very strong cement of their love, and indeed
of all their other virtues; for, as the general register of their
actions, which we have before spoken of, is read at these
meetings, those who have deserved well of the community, are
honoured by some token or distinction in the sight of all the
rest; and those who have done anything against their fundamental
laws, have some mark of ignominy put upon them; for they have no
high sense of pecuniary rewards, and they think the punishing of
the body of little service towards amending the mind. Experience
has shown them, that, by keeping up this nice sense of honour and
shame, they are always enabled to keep their community in better
order than the most severe corporeal punishments have been able to
effect in other governments.

But what has still more tended to preserve their happiness is,
that they know no other use of riches than the enjoyment of them;
but, as the word is liable to be misconstrued by many of our
readers, we think it necessary to inform them, we do not mean by
it that sordid enjoyment which the miser feels when he bolts up
his money in a well-secured iron chest, or that delicious pleasure
he is sensible of when he counts over his hoarded stores, and
finds they are increased with a half-guinea, or even a half-crown;
nor do we mean that enjoyment which the well-known Mr. K—, the man
eater, feels when he draws out his money from his bags, to
discount the good bills of some honest but distressed tradesman at
fifteen or twenty per cent.

[Note: As it has been long a dispute among the learned and travellers,
whether or no there are cannibals or man-eaters existing, it may seem
something strange that we should assert there is, beyond all doubt, one
of that species often seen lurking near St. Paul's, in the city of
London, and other parts of that city, seeking whom he may devour.]

The people we are speaking of are happily ignorant of such
enjoyment of money, for they know no other use of it than that of
promoting mirth and good humour; for which end they generously
bring their gains into a common stock, whereby they whose gains
are small have an equal enjoyment with those whose profits are
larger, excepting only that a mark of ignominy is affixed on those
who do not contribute to the common stock proportionably to their
abilities, and the opportunities they have of gain; and this is
the source of their uninterrupted happiness; for by this means
they have no griping usurer to grind them, lordly possessor to
trample on them, nor any envyings to torment them; they have no
settled habitations, but, like the Scythians of old, remove from
place to place, as often as their conveniency or pleasure requires
it, which renders their life a perpetual scene of the greatest
variety.

By what we have said above, and much more that we could add, of
the happiness of these people, and of their peculiar attachment to
each other, we may account for what has been matter of much
surprise to the friends of our hero, viz., his strong attachment,
for the space of above forty years, to this community, and his
refusing the large offers that have been made to quit their
society.—But to return to our history.

Thus was Mr. Carew initiated into the mysteries of a society,
which, for antiquity, need give place to none, as is evident from
the name, which in Latin is called Egyptus, and in the French
Egyptienne, that they derive their original from the Egyptians,
one of the most ancient and learned people in the world,(though
afterwards several other people imitated them) and that they were
persons of more than common learning, who travelled to communicate
their knowledge to mankind. Whether the divine Homer himself might
not have been of this society, will admit of a doubt, as there is
much uncertainty about his birth and education, though nothing is
more certain than that he travelled from place to place.

Mr. Carew did not continue long in it before he was consulted in
important matters; particularly Madam Musgrove, of Monkton, near
Taunton, hearing of his fame, sent for him to consult in an affair
of difficulty. When he came, she informed him, that she suspected
a large quantity of money was buried somewhere about her house,
and if he would acquaint her with the particular place, she would
handsomely reward him.

Our hero consulted the secrets of his art upon this occasion, and
after long toil and study informed the lady, that under a laurel-
tree in the garden lay the treasure she anxiously sought for; but
that her planet of good fortune did not reign till such a day and
hour, till which time she should desist from searching for it; the
good lady rewarded him very generously with twenty guineas for his
discovery. We cannot tell whether at this time our hero was
sufficiently initiated in the art, or whether the lady mistook her
lucky hour, but the strict regard we pay to truth obliges us to
confess, that the lady dug below the roots of the laurel-tree
without finding the hidden treasure.

When he was further initiated in the art, he was consulted upon
several important matters, and generally gave satisfaction by his
sagacious answers. In the meantime, his worthy parents sorrowed
for him as one that was no more, not being able to get the least
tidings of him, though they publicly advertised him, and sent
messengers after him in every direction; till, at the expiration
of a year and a half, our hero having repeated accounts of the
sorrow and trouble his parents were in upon his account, his heart
melted with tenderness, and he repaired to his father's house, at
Brickley, in Devonshire. As he was much disguised, both in habit
and countenance, he was not at first known by his parents; but
when he discovered himself, joy gushed out in full streams,
stopping the power of speech: but the warm tears they bedewed his
cheeks with, whilst they imprinted them with kisses, performed the
office of the tongue with more expressive eloquence; but the good
heart and tender parent will feel this much better than we can
describe. The whole neighbourhood, particularly the two parishes
of Cadley and Brickley, partook of this joy; and there was nothing
for some time but ringing of bells, with public feasting, and
other marks of festive joy.

Mr. Carew's parents did everything possible to render home
agreeable to him; every day he was engaged in some party of
pleasure or other, and all his friends strove who should entertain
him, so that there seemed nothing wanting to his happiness. But
the uncommon pleasure that he had enjoyed in the community he had
left, the freedom of their government, the simplicity and
sincerity of their manners, the frequent changes of their
habitation, the perpetual mirth and good humour that reigned
amongst them, and perhaps some secret presages of that high honour
which he has since arrived at; all these made too deep an
impression to be effaced by any other ideas; his pleasure
therefore grew every day more and more tasteless, and he relished
none of those entertainments which his friends daily provided for
him.

For some time these unsatisfied longings after the community of
Gypsies preyed upon his mind, his heart being too good to think of
leaving his fond parents again, without reluctance. Long did
filial piety and his inclinations struggle for the victory; at
length the last prevailed, but not till his health had visibly
suffered by these inward commotions. One day, therefore, without
taking leave of any of his friends, he directed his steps towards
Brick-house, at Tiverton, where he had at first entered into the
community of the Gypsies; and finding some of them there, he
joined their company, to the great satisfaction of them, as well
as of himself; they rejoiced greatly at having regained one who
was likely to be so useful a member to their community.

Chapter II
His First Ventures as an Imposter

We are now entering into the busy part of our hero's life, where
we shall find him acting in various characters, and performing all
with propriety, dignity, and decorum.—We shall, therefore, rather
choose to account for some of the actions of our hero, by desiring
the reader to keep in mind the principles of the government of the
mendicants, which are, like those of the Algerines and other
states of Barbary, in a perpetual state of hostility with most
other people; so that whatsoever stratagems or deceits they can
over-reach them by, are not only allowed by their laws, but
considered as commendable and praise-worthy; and, as the Algerines
are looked upon as a very honest people by those who are in
alliance with them, though they plunder the rest of mankind; and
as most other governments have thought that they might very
honestly attack any weak neighbouring state, whenever it was
convenient for them, and murder forty or fifty thousand of the
human species; we hope, to the unprejudiced eye of reason, the
government of the Gypsies in general, and our hero as a member of
it, will not appear in so disadvantageous a light, for exercising
a few stratagems to over-reach their enemies, especially when it
is considered they never, like other states, do any harm to the
persons of their enemies, and nothing considerable to their
fortunes.

Our hero being again admitted at the first general assembly of the
Gypsies, and having taken the proper oaths of allegiance to the
sovereign, was soon after sent out by him on a cruise upon their
enemies.

Our hero's wit was now set to work, by what stratagems he might
best succeed. The first that occurred to his thoughts was that of
equipping himself with an old pair of trousers, enough of a jacket
to cover his nakedness, stockings such as nature gave, shoes (or
rather the body of shoes, for soles they had none) which had leaks
enough to sink a first rate man of war, and a woollen cap, so
black that one might more safely swear it had not been washed
since Noah's flood, than any electors can that they receive no
bribes. Being thus attired, our hero changed his manners with his
dress; he forgot entirely his family, education, and politeness,
and became neither more nor less than an unfortunate shipwrecked
seaman.

Here, if we may be allowed to compare great things with small, we
could wish that all orders of men were strict imitators of our
hero; we mean that they would put on the characteristics and
qualifications of their employment, at the same time they invest
themselves with the ensigns of it; that the divine, when he puts
on his sacred and venerable habit, would clothe himself with
piety, goodness, gentleness, long-suffering, charity, temperance,
contempt of filthy lucre, and other godlike qualifications of his
office; that the judge, at the time he puts on his ermined robes,
would put on righteousness and equity as an upper garment, with an
integrity of mind more white and spotless than the fairest ermine;
that the grave physician, when he puts on his large periwig, would
put under it the knowledge of the human frame, of the virtues and
effects of his medicines, of the signs and nature of diseases,
with the most approved and experienced forms of cure; that the
mechanic, when he puts on his leather or woollen apron, put on
diligence, frugality, temperance, modesty, and good nature; and
that kings themselves, when the crown, which is adorned with many
precious stones, is put on their heads, would put on at the same
time the more inestimable gems of all the precious virtues; that
they would remember at times, they were invested with the
dalmatica at their coronation, only as an emblem of the ornament
of a good life and holy actions; that the rod they received was
the rod of virtue and equity, to encourage and make much of the
godly, and to terrify the wicked; to show the way to those that go
astray, and to offer the hand to those that fall; to repress the
proud, and to lift up the lowly; and the sword they were girt
with, was to protect the liberties of their people, to defend and
help widows and orphans, restore the things which have gone to
decay, maintain those which are restored, and confirm things that
are in good order.
[Note: At the coronation of the kings of England, before the Archbishop
puts the crown upon the king's head, he makes this prayer, holding the
crown in his hand:—"O God, the crown of the faithful, who crowneth their
heads with precious stones that trust in thee, bless and sanctify this
crown, that, as the same is adorned with many precious stones, so this
thy servant, that weareth the same, may of thy grace be replenished with
the manifest gift of all precious virtues," &c.
	When the Archbishop puts the dalmatica, or white robe studded with
purple, on the king, he makes the following prayer:—"O God, the King of
kings, and Lord of lords; by whom kings do reign, and lawgivers do make
good laws, vouchsafe in thy grace to bless this kingly ornament, and
grant that thy servant, our king, who doth wear it, may shine in thy
sight with the ornament of a good life and holy actions," &c.
	When the Archbishop delivers the rod with the dove into the king's
left hand, he say:—"Receive the rod of virtue and equity: learn to make
much of the godly, and to terrify the wicked: show the way to those that
go astray, offer the hand to those that fall, repress the proud, lift up
the lowly," &c.
	When the Archbishop delivers the sword into the king's right hand,
he says:—"Receive this kingly sword for the defence of the faith of
Christ's holy church, and with it exercise thou the force of equity, and
mightily destroy the growth of iniquity, protect the holy church of God,
and his people : defend and help widows and orphans; restore the things
that are going to decay; maintain those things which are restored; be
revenged of injustice, and confirm things that are in good order."]

As to our hero, he so fully put on the character of a shipwrecked
seaman, that in his first excursion he gained a very considerable
booty, having likewise ingeniously imitated the passes and
certificates that were necessary for him to travel with
unmolested.

After about a month's travel, he accidentally, at Kingsbridge, in
Devonshire, met with Coleman, his late school-fellow, one of those
who entered with him into the community, as before related, but
had, after a year and a half's sojourn, left them and returned to
his friends: however, not finding that satisfaction among them as
with the Gypsies, he had again joined that people: great was the
joy, therefore, of these two friends at their meeting, and they
soon agreed to travel together for some time; and accordingly
proceeded to Totness, from thence to the city of Exeter, where
they raised a contribution in one day amounting to several pounds.

Having obtained all he could desire from this stratagem, his
fruitful invention soon hinted another. He now became the plain
honest country farmer, who, living in the Isle of Sheppey, in
Kent, had the misfortune to have his grounds overflowed, and all
his cattle drowned. His habit was now neat but rustic; his air and
behaviour simple and inoffensive; his speech in the Kentish
dialect; his countenance dejected; his tale pitiful, nay wondrous
pitiful; a wife and seven helpless infants being partakers of his
misfortunes; so that if his former stratagem answered his wishes,
this did still more so, he now getting seldom less than a guinea a
day.

Having raised a considerable booty by these two stratagems, he
made the best of his way towards Stratton, in Devonshire, where
was soon to be held a general assembly of the Gypsies: here he was
received with great applause, on account of the successful
stratagems he had executed, and he had an honourable mark of
distinction bestowed upon him, being seated near the king.

Though our hero, by means of these stratagems, abounded with all
the pleasures he could desire, yet he began now to reflect with
himself on that grand and noble maxim of life, that we are not
born for ourselves only, but indebted to all mankind, to be of as
great use and service to them, as our capacities and abilities
will enable us to be; he, therefore, gave a handsome gratuity to a
famous rat-catcher (who assumed the honour of being rat-catcher to
the king, and produced a patent for the free exercise of his art)
to be initiated into that, and the still more useful secret of
curing madness in dogs or cattle.

Our hero, by his close application, soon attained so considerable
a knowledge in his profession, that he practised with much success
and applause, to the great advantage of the public in general, not
confining the good effects of his knowledge to his own community
only, but extending them universally to all sorts of people,
wheresoever they were wanted; for though we have before observed
that the mendicants are in a constant state of hostility with all
other people, and Mr. Carew was as alert as anyone in laying all
manner of schemes and stratagems to carry off a booty from them;
yet he thought, as a member of the grand society of human kind, he
was obliged to do them all the good in his power, when it was not
opposite to the interest of that particular community of which he
was a member.

Mr. Carew's invention being never at a loss, he now formed a new
stratagem; to execute which, he exchanged his habit, shirt, &c.,
for only an old blanket; shoes and stockings he laid aside,
because they did not suit his present purpose. Being thus
accoutred, or rather unaccoutred, he was now no more than "Poor
Mad Tom, whom the foul fiend had led through fire and through
flame, through ford and whirlpool, over bog and quagmire, that
hath laid knives under his pillow, and halters in his pew, set
ratsbane by his porridge, made him proud at heart to ride on a bay
trotting horse over four-inch bridges, to curse his own shadow for
a traitor; who eats the swimming frog, the toad, the tadpole, the
wall-newt, and the water-newt; that in the fury of his heart, when
the foul fiend rages, swallows the old rat and ditch dog, drinks
the green mantle off the standing pool;
And mice and rats, and such small gear,
Have been Tom's food for seven long year.

O do, de, do, de, do, de; bless thee from whirlwind, star-
blasting, and taking; do poor Tom some charity, whom the foul
fiend vexes; there could I have him now, and there, and there
again, and there; through the sharp hawthorn blows the cold wind;
Tom's a-cold! who gives anything to poor Tom?"—In this character,
and with such like expressions, our hero entered the house both of
great and small, claiming kindred to them, and committing all
manner of frantic actions; such as beating himself, offering to
eat coals of fire, running against the wall, and tearing to pieces
those garments that were given him to cover his nakedness; by
which means he raised very considerable contributions.

But these different habits and characters were still of farther
use to our hero, for by their means he had a better opportunity of
seeing the world, and knowing mankind, than most of our youths who
make the grand tour; for, as he had none of those petty amusements
and raree-shows, which so much divert our young gentlemen abroad,
to engage his attention, it was wholly applied to the study of
mankind, their various passions and inclinations; and he made the
greater improvement in his study, as in many of his characters
they acted before him without reserve or disguise. He saw in
little and plain houses hospitality, charity and compassion, the
children of frugality; and found under gilded and spacious roofs,
littleness, uncharitableness and inhumanity, the offspring of
luxury and riot; he saw servants waste their master's substance,
and that there were no greater nor more crafty thieves than
domestic ones; and met with masters who roared out for liberty
abroad, acting the arbitrary tyrants in their own houses:—he saw
ignorance and passion exercise the rod of justice; oppression, the
handmaid of power; self-interest outweighing friendship and
honesty in the opposite scale; pride and envy spurning and
trampling on what was more worthy than themselves;—he saw the pure
white robes of truth sullied with the black hue of hypocrisy and
dissimulation; he sometimes, too, met much riches unattended by
pomp and pride, but diffusing themselves in numberless unexhausted
streams, conducted by the hands of two lovely servants, Goodness
and Beneficence;—and he saw honesty, integrity and goodness of
mind, inhabitants of the humble cot of poverty.

All these observations afforded him no little pleasure, but he
felt a much greater in the indulgence of the emotions of filial
piety, paying his parents frequent visits, unknown to them, in
different disguises; at which time, the tenderness he saw them
express in their inquiries after him (it being their constant
custom so to do of all travellers) always melted him into real
tears.


Chapter III
His Trip to Newfoundland; Impersonating a
Shipwrecked Fisherman.

It has been remarked, that curiosity, or the desire of knowledge,
is that which most distinguishes man from the brute, and the
greater the mind is, the more insatiable is that passion: we may,
without flattery, say no man had a more boundless one than our
hero; for, not satisfied with the observations he had made in
England and Wales, (which we are well assured were many more than
are usually made by gentlemen before they travel into foreign
parts,) he now resolved to see other countries and manners. He was
the more inclined to this, as he imagined it would enable him to
be of greater service to the community of which he was a member,
by rendering him capable of executing some of his stratagems with
much greater success.

He communicated this design to his school-fellow, Escott, one of
those who joined the Gypsies with him, (for neither of the four
wholly quitted the community). Escott very readily agreed to
accompany him in his travels, and there being a vessel ready to
sail for Newfoundland, lying at Dartmouth, where they then were,
they agreed to embark on board her, being called the Mainsail,
commanded by captain Hollingsworth. Nothing remarkable happened in
their passage which relates to our hero; we shall therefore pass
it by, and land him safe in Newfoundland.

This large island was discovered by Sebastian Cabot, who was sent
to America by Henry the VIIth. king of England, in the year 1497,
to make discoveries. It is of a triangular figure, as big as
Ireland, of about 300 leagues in circuit, separated from Canada or
New France on the continent to the north, and Nova Scotia to the
south, by a channel of much the same breadth as that between Dover
and Calais. It lies between 46 and 50 degrees of north latitude.
It is not above 1800 miles distant from the Land's-end of England.
It has many commodious bays along the coast, some of them running
into the land towards one another 20 leagues. The climate is very
hot in summer and cold in the winter, the snow lying upon the
ground four or five months in the year; the soil is very barren,
bearing little or no corn, being full of mountains and
impenetrable forests; its meadows are like heath, and covered with
- a sort of moss instead of grass.

Our hero, nevertheless, did not spend his time uselessly, nor even
without entertainment, in this uncomfortable country; for an
inquisitive and active mind will find more use and entertainment
among barren rocks and mountains, than the indolent person can
amongst all the magnificence and beauty of Versailles ; he
therefore visited Torbay, Kitaway, Carboneer, Brigas Bay, Bay of
Bulls, Pretty Harbour, Cape Broil, Bonavista, and all the other
settlements, both English and French, actually making himself
fully acquainted with the names, circumstances, and characters, of
all the inhabitants of any note. He also visited the great bank of
Newfoundland, so much talked of, which is a mountain of sand lying
under the sea, above 450 miles in length, and in some places 150
in breadth, lying on the east side of the island : the sea, that
runs over it, when it is flood, is 200 fathoms deep on all sides,
so that at that time the largest ships may venture upon it without
fear of striking, except at a place called the Virgins; but at the
ebb it is dry in some places. He also visited the other lesser
banks, viz. Vert Bank, about 240 miles long; the Bancuero Bank
lying in the shape of a shoe, about the bigness of the other: but
the greatest entertainment, and what seemed most worthy of his
observation, was the great cod fishery, which is carried on about
the great and other banks near the coast, for which purpose,
during his stay there, he saw several hundred ships come in from
different parts, both of America and Europe, so that he had an
opportunity of gaining some knowledge of a considerable part of
the world by inquiries, he missing no opportunity of conversing
with the sailors of different countries. He was told several of
these ships carried away thirty or thirty-five thousand fish a-
piece; and, though this yearly consumption has been made for two
centuries past, yet the same plenty of fish continues without any
diminution.

He observed that there are two sorts of salt cod, the one called
green or white, the other dried or cured; but they are both the
same fish, only differently prepared. The best, largest, and
fattest cod, are those taken on the south side of the Great Bank;
and the best season is from the beginning of February to the end
of April; for then the cod, which during the winter had retired to
the deepest part of the sea, return, to the bank, and grow very
fat. Those caught from March to June keep well enough, which
cannot be said of those taken in July, August, and September. An
experienced fisherman, though he only takes one fish at a time,
will catch three hundred and fifty or four hundred in a day, but
seldom so many; for it is a very fatiguing work, both on account
of the weight of the fish, and the cold that reigns about the
Bank. When the heads of the fish are cut off, their bellies
opened, and the ,guts taken out, the salter (on whose ability and
care the success of the voyage chiefly depends) ranges them in the
bottom of the vessel, and having made a layer there of a fathom or
two square, he covers it with salt; over this he lays another, and
covers it as before: and thus disposes of all the fish of one day,
taking care never to mix the fish of different days together. When
the cod have thus lain to drain for three or four days, they are
moved into another part of the vessel, and salted a second time;
and this is all the preparation these green fish undergo.

The principal fishery for cod intended to be dried is along the
southern coast of Newfoundland, where there are several commodious
ports to carry the fish ashore; and though the fish are smaller
here than at the Bank, on that account they are fitter to keep,
and the salt penetrates them the better. As cod are only to be
dried in the sun, the European vessels are obliged to put to sea
in March or April, in order to have the benefit of summer for
drying Some vessels indeed are sent in June or July, but those
only purchase fish already prepared by the English settled in
Newfoundland, giving meal, brandy, biscuit, pulse, linen, &c. in
exchange. When the ships arrive in the spring, and have fixed upon
a station, some of the crew build a stage or scaffold on the
shore, whilst the rest are fishing and as fast as they can catch
their fish they land them, open them, and salt them on moveable
benches; but the main salting is performed on the scaffold. As
soon as the fish have taken salt, they wash them and lay them on
piles to drain. When drained, tiny range them on hurdles, head to
tail; and, whilst they lie thus, they turn them four times every
twenty-four hours. As they begin to dry, they lay them in heaps
often or twelve a-piece, and continue to enlarge the heaps every
day, till they are double their first bulk. At length they join
two of these heaps together, and turn them every day as before.
Lastly, they salt them over again, beginning with those that have
been salted first, and then lay them in large piles as big as hay-
stacks. Thus they remain till they are carried on ship-board,
where they are laid on branches of trees, disposed for that
purpose, at the bottom of the vessel, with mats all round, to
prevent their contracting any moisture. Besides the fish itself,
there are other commodities obtained from it, viz. the tripes and
tongues, which are salted at the same time with the fish, and put
up in barrels; the roes, or eggs, which, being salted and barreled
up, are of use to cast into the sea to draw fish together,
particularly pilchards; and the oil which is drawn from the
livers, is used in dressing of leather.
The fishing season being over, and our hero having made all the
observations that he thought might be useful to him, and returned
in the same vessel to Dartmouth, from whence he had at first
sailed, bringing with him a surprising fierce and large dog, which
he had enticed to follow him, and made as gentle as a lamb, by an
art peculiar to himself. Our hero was received with great joy by
his fellow Gypsies, and they were loud in his praises, when they
understood he had undertaken this voyage to enable him to deceive
his enemies with the greater success. He accordingly, in a few
days, went out on a cruise in the character of a shipwrecked
seaman, lost in a vessel homeward bound from Newfoundland,
sometimes belonging to Poole, sometimes to Dartmouth, at other
times to other ports, and under such or such commander, according
as the newspapers gave account of such melancholy accidents.

If the booty he got before under this character was considerable,
it was much more so now, for being able to give an exact account
of Newfoundland, the settlements, harbours, fishery, and the
inhabitants thereof, he applied with great confidence to masters
of vessels, and gentlemen well acquainted with those parts; so
that those to whom before his prudence would not let him apply,
now became his greatest benefactors, as the perfect account he
gave of the country engaged them to give credit to all he
asserted, and made them very liberal in his favour.


Chapter IV
He Falls Victim to the Tender Passion

It was about this time our hero became sensible of the power of
love; we mean of that sort which has more of the mind than the
body, and is tender, delicate and constant; the object of which
remains constantly fixed in the mind, and will not admit of any
partner with it. It was in the town of Newcastle, so famous for
its coal-works, which our hero visited out of curiosity, appearing
there undisguised and making a very genteel appearance, that he
became enamoured with the daughter of Mr. Gray, an eminent surgeon
there. This young lady had charms perhaps equal to any of her sex;
and we might in that style, which one, who calls himself an author
of the first rate, calls the sublime, say, "Here was whiteness,
which no lilies, ivory, nor alabaster could match. The finest
cambric might be supposed from envy to cover that bosom, which was
much whiter than itself;" but we must confess we always feel a
cold horror shoot through our limbs at the reading of this puerile 
sublime, and we make no doubt but many other readers do the same,
as it greatly tends "infandum renovare dolorem" [to remember
frightful suffering] to make our hearts ache by putting us in mind
of what our posteriors have suffered from us at school. We shall
therefore content ourselves by saying, this lady had charms
sufficient to captivate the heart of any man not unsusceptible of
love; and they made so deep an impression upon our hero, that they
wholly effaced every object which before had created any desire in
him, and never permitted any other to raise them afterwards; and,
wonderful to tell, we have after about thirty years enjoyment,
seen him lament her occasional absence almost with tears, and talk
of her with all the fondness of one who had been in love but three
days. Our hero tried all love's soft persuasions with his fair one
in an honourable way; and, as his person was very engaging, and
his appearance genteel, he did not find her greatly averse to the
proposals. As he was aware that his being of the community of the
Gypsies might prejudice her against him without examination, he
passed with her for the mate of a collier's vessel, in which he
was supported by Captain L—n of Dartmouth, an old acquaintance of
our hero's, who then commanded a vessel lying at Newcastle, and
acknowledged him for his mate. These assertions satisfied the
young lady very well, and she at length consented to exchange the
tender care and love of a parent for that of a husband. The reader
may perhaps be surprised that she did not make any farther
inquiries about him; it is therefore necessary that we should
inform him, that our hero had engaged on his side a very eloquent
and persuasive advocate or counsellor, for we know not which
denomination most properly belongs to him; one, though still
beardless, existed as soon as the first woman was created, and has
had ever since, till within this last century, very great practice
in the business of uniting both sexes for life; but of late years
a neighbouring counsellor, named self-interest, has by underhand
dealings, false insinuations, and mean suggestions, taken away the
greatest part of his business, so that he is seldom retained on
either side. Our hero, however, engaged him in his service, and he
pleaded so strongly for him in the young lady, that he removed all
her objections, and silenced all her scruples, and at last
persuaded her to leave her home and venture on board Captain L—n's
vessel with her lover; for, though this counsellor, according to a
very good picture of him drawn by a famous master, has more of the
wanton roguish smiles of a boy in his countenance, than the
formality, wisdom, and gravity of those counsellors whom thou hast
perhaps seen in Westminster-hall; and never wore one of those
ponderous perukes which are so essential to the knowledge, wisdom,
and eloquence of those gentlemen; yet we are assured none of them
ever equalled him in persuasive arguments, removing of
difficulties, and silencing of doubts; for he indeed differs in
practice from most of the counsellors we ever heard of: for, as
these are apt to puzzle and perplex their clients by their
answers, and make intricate what was plain before, on the
contrary, the gentleman we are speaking of had a wonderful faculty
of making the greatest difficulties plain and easy, and always
answered every objection and scruple to the entire satisfaction of
his client.

The lover and his fair one being on board, they soon hoisted sail,
and the very winds being willing to favour these two happy lovers,
they had an exceeding quick passage to Dartmouth, where they
landed. Our hero being now no longer able to conceal his being a
member of the community of Gypsies, after some previous
introduction, declared it to the young lady, who was not a little
surprised and troubled at it; but the counsellor we have already
spoken of being near at hand, soon composed her mind, by
suggesting to her the worthy family her lover was sprung from;
that the community of the Gypsies was more happy, and less
disreputable than she imagined, that the person of her lover was
quite amiable, and that he had good nature, and love enough to
make her happy in any condition.

As these suggestions entirely satisfied her, the lovers in a few
days set out for Bath, where they lawfully solemnized their
nuptials with great gaiety and splendour, and were those two
persons whom many of the old standers at Bath remembered for many
years after to have made such an éclat, but nobody could, at the
time, conjecture who they were, which was the occasion of much
speculation and many false surmises.

We cannot conclude on this head, but with the deserved praises of
our hero, from whose mouth we have had repeated assurance, that,
during their voyage to Dartmouth, and their journey from thence to
Bath, not the least indignity was offered to the innocence or
modesty of his dear Miss Gray.

Our lovers began to be at length weary of the same repeated rounds
of pleasure at Bath, for at that time the wit of man had not
reached so high as the invention of that most charming,
entertaining, never-cloying diversion, called E—O, which seems to
have been reserved among the secrets of fate to do honour to the
present age; for upon the nicest scrutiny, we are quite convinced
it is entirely new, and cannot find the least traces of its being
borrowed from any nation under the sun; for, though we have with
great pains and labour inquired into all the games and diversions
of the ancients; though we have followed untutored Indians through
all their revels, and though we have accurately examined into the
dull pleasures of the uncouth Hottentots; yet in all these we find
either some marks of ingenuity to exercise and refresh the mind,
or something of labour to invigorate the body;—we therefore could
not avoid interrupting our history, to do honour to this truly
interesting and original game.

Our lovers having left Bath, visited next the city of Bristol,
where they stayed some time, and caused more speculation there
than they had before done at Bath, and did as much damage to that
city as the famous Lucullus did at Rome, on his return from his
victorious expedition; we have some reason to think they first
introduced the love of dress among those plain and frugal
citizens. After some stay here, they made a tour through Somerset
and Dorset to Hampshire, where they paid a visit to an uncle of
our hero's living then at Dorchester, near Gosport, who was a
clergyman of distinguished merit and character; here they were
received with great politeness and hospitality, and abode a
considerable time. His uncle took this opportunity of making use
of every argument to persuade him to quit the community of the
Gypsies; but our hero was so thoroughly fixed in his principles,
that even that argument which oftentimes convinces patriots in a
few hours, that all they said and did before was wrong, that kings
have a divine right to grind the faces of their subjects, and that
power which lays its iron hand on Nabal's goodly vineyard, and
says, This is mine, for so I will, is preferable to heavenly
liberty, which says to every man, Possess what is thine own, reap
what thou hast sown, gather what thou hast planted, eat, drink,
and lie down secure; even this powerful argument had no effect
upon our hero; for, though his uncle made him very lucrative
offers for the present, and future promises of making him heir of
all his possessions, yet remembering his engagements with the
Gypsies, he rejected them all; and reflecting that he had long
lived useless to that community, he began to prepare for his
departure from his uncle's, in order to make some incursions on
the enemy.


Chapter V
He Impersonates a Clergyman

To do this with more effect, he bethought himself of a new
stratagem. He therefore equips himself in a loose black gown, puts
on a band, a large white peruke, and a broad-brimmed hat; his
whole deportment was agreeable to his dress; his pace was solemn
and slow, his countenance thoughtful and grave, his eyes turned on
the ground, but now and then raised in seeming ejaculations to
heaven: in every look and action he betrayed his want, but at the
same time seemed overwhelmed with that shame which modest merit
feels, when it is obliged to solicit the cold hand of charity;
this behaviour excited the curiosity of many gentlemen, clergy,
&c., to inquire into the circumstances of his misfortunes; but it
was with difficulty they could engage him to relate them, it being
with much seeming reluctance that he acquainted them with his
having exercised for many years the sacred office of a clergyman
at Aberystwyth, a parish in Wales; but that the government
changing, he had preferred quitting his benefice, to taking an
oath contrary to his principles and conscience. This relation he
accompanied with frequent sighs, deep marks of adoration of the
ways of Providence, and warm expressions of his firm trust and
reliance in its goodness and faithfulness, with high encomiums on
the inward satisfaction of a good conscience. When he discoursed
with any clergyman, or other person of literature, he would now
and then introduce some Latin or Greek sentences, that were
applicable to what they were talking about, which gave his hearers
a high opinion of his learning; all this, and his thorough
knowledge of those persons whom it was proper to apply to, made
this stratagem succeed even beyond his own expectations.

But now, hearing of a vessel bound to Philadelphia, on board of
which were many Quakers, being cast away on the coast of Ireland,
he laid aside his gown, cassock, and band, clothes himself in a
plain suit, pulls the button from his hat, and flaps it on every
side; his countenance was now demure, his language unadorned with
any flowers of speech, and the words You and Sir, he seemed to
hold in abomination; his hat was moved to none, for, though under
misfortunes, he would not think of bowing the knee to Baal.

With these qualifications, he addressed himself to persons of the
denomination of Quakers with great success (for indeed it is to be
wished that all other sects would imitate them in their readiness
to relieve their brethren); and hearing that there was to be a
great meeting of them from all parts, at a place called
Thorncombe, in Devonshire, he makes the best of his way there; and
with a demure look and modest assurance enters the assembly,
where, making his case known, and satisfying them, by his
behaviour, of his being one of their sect, they made a very
considerable subscription for his relief.

So active was the mind of our hero, that he was never more happy
than when engaged in some adventure or other; therefore, when he
had no opportunity of putting any great stratagem in execution, he
would amuse himself with those which did not require so great a
share of art and ingenuity. Whenever he heard of any melancholy
accident by fire, he immediately repaired to the place where it
happened, and there, remarking very accurately the spot, inquired
into the cause of it, and getting an exact information of the
trades, characters, families, and circumstances of the unhappy
sufferers, he immediately assumed the person and name of one of
them; and burning some part of his coat and hat, as an ocular
demonstration of his narrow escape, he made the best of his way to
places at some distance, and there passed for one who had been
burnt out; and to gain credit, showed a paper signed with the
names of several gentlemen in the neighbourhood of the place where
the fire happened, recommending him as an honest unhappy sufferer,
by which he got considerable sums. Under this character, he had
once the boldness to address Justice Hall, of Exmouth, in Devon,
the terror and professed enemy of every order of the Gypsies;
however, our hero managed so artfully, (though he went through a
strict examination,) that he at last convinced his worship that he
was an honest miller, whose house, mill, and whole substance had
been consumed by fire, occasioned by the negligence of an
apprentice boy, and was accordingly relieved by the justice.


Chapter VI
Further impostures

Coming one day to Squire Portman's, at Brinson, near Blandford, in
the character of a rat-catcher, with a hairy cap upon his head, a
buff girdle about his waist, and a tame rat in a little box by his
side, he boldly marched up to the house in this disguise, though
his person was well known by the family, and meeting in the court
with Mr. Portman, the Rev. Mr. Bryant, and several other gentlemen
whom he well knew, but did not suspect he should be known by them,
he accosted them as a rat-catcher, asking if their Honours had any
rats to kill. Do you understand your business well? replied Mr.
Portman. Yes, and please your honour; I have followed it many
years, and have been employed in his majesty's yards and ships. 
Well, go in and get something to eat; and after dinner we will try
your abilities.

Our hero was accordingly placed at the second table to dinner, and
very handsomely entertained; after which he was called into a
great parlour, among a large company of gentlemen and ladies.
Well, honest Mr. Rat-catcher, said Mr. Portman, can you lay any
schemes to kill the rats, without hurting my dogs? Yes, boldly
replied Mr. Carew, I shall lay it where even cats can't climb to
reach it. And what countryman are you, pray? A Devonshire man,
please your honour. What may be your name? Our hero now
perceiving, by the smiles and whispering of the gentlemen, that he
was known, replied very composedly, B, a, m, p, f, y, l, d, e, M,
o, o, r, e, C, a, r, e, w. This occasioned a good deal of mirth;
and Mr. Carew asking what scabby sheep had infected the whole
flock? was told, Parson Bryant was the man who had discovered him,
none of the other gentlemen knowing him under his disguise: upon
which, turning to the parson, he asked him if he had forgotten
good king Charles's rules? Mr. Pleydell, of St. Andrew's,
Milbourn, expressed a pleasure at seeing the famous Mr. Bampfylde-
Moore Carew, saying he had never seen him before. Yes, but you
have, replied he, and gave me a suit of clothes. Mr. Pleydell
testified some surprise at this, and desired to know when it was.
Mr. Carew asked him if he did not remember a poor wretch met him
one day at his stable-door with an old stocking round his head
instead of a cap, and a woman's old ragged mantle on his
shoulders, no shirt on his back, nor stockings to his legs, and
scarce any shoes on his feet; and that he asked him if he was mad?
to which he replied No; but a poor unfortunate man, cast away on
the coast, and taken up, with eight others, by a Frenchman, the
rest of the crew, sixteen in number, being all drowned; and that
Mr. Pleydell having asked what countryman he was, gave him a
guinea and a suit of clothes. Mr. Pleydell said he well remembered
such a poor object. Well, replied our hero, that object was no
other than the rat-catcher now before you: at which all the
company laughed very heartily. Well, said Mr. Pleydell, I will bet
a guinea I shall know you again, come in what shape you will: the
same said Mr. Seymour, of Handford. Some of the company asserting
to the contrary of this, they desired our hero to try his
ingenuity upon them, and then to discover himself, to convince
them of it.

This being agreed upon, and having received a handsome
contribution of this company, he took his leave; but Parson Bryant
followed him out, and acquainted him that the same company, and
many more, would be at Mr. Pleydell's on such a day, and advised
him to make use of that opportunity to deceive them all together;
which our hero soon resolved to do. He therefore revolved in his
mind what stratagem was most likely to succeed: at length he fixed
upon one, which he thought could not fail answering his purpose.

When the day was come, the barber was called in to make his face
as smooth as his art could do, and a woman's gown and other female
accoutrements of the largest size were provided for him. Having
jumped into his petticoats, pinned a large dowde under his chin,
and put a high-crowned hat on his head, he made a figure so
comical that even Hogarth's humour can scarcely parallel; yet our
hero thought himself of something else to render his disguise more
impenetrable: he therefore borrowed a little hump-backed child of
a tinker, and two more of some others of his community. There
remained now only in what situation to place the children, and it
was quickly resolved to tie two to his back, and to take the other
in his arms.

Thus accoutred, and thus hung with helpless infants, he marched
forwards for Mr. Pleydell's; coming up to the door, he put his
hand behind him, and pinched one of the children, which set it a
roaring; this gave the alarm to the dogs, so that between their
barking and the child's crying, the whole family was sufficiently
disturbed. Out came the maid, crying, Carry away the children, old
woman, they disturb the ladies. God bless their ladyships, I am
the poor unfortunate grandmother to these poor helpless infants,
whose dear mother and all they had was burnt at the dreadful fire
at Kirton, and hope the good ladies, for God's sake, will bestow
something on the poor famishing starving infants. This moving
story was accompanied with tears; upon which, the maid ran in to
acquaint the ladies with this melancholy tale, while the good
grandmother kept pinching one or other of the children, that they
might play their parts to greater perfection; the maid soon
returned with a half crown from the ladies, and some good broth,
which he went into the court-yard to eat, (understanding the
gentlemen were not in the house,) and got one of the under-
servants, whom he met, to give some to the children on his back.
He had not long been there, before the gentlemen all came in
together, who accosted him with, Where did you come from, my good
old woman? From Kirton, please your honours, where the poor
unfortunate mother of these helpless babes was burnt to death by
the flames, and all they had consumed.  D—n you, said one of the
gentlemen, (who is well known by the name of Worthy Sir, and was
particularly acquainted with Mr. Carew,) there has been more money
collected for Kirton than ever Kirton was worth; however, he gave
this good old grandmother a shilling, the other gentlemen likewise
relieved her, commiserating her age, and her burden of so many
helpless infants; not one of them discovering our hero in the old
woman, who received their alms very thankfully, and pretended to
go away; but the gentlemen were not got into the house before
their ears were saluted with a tantivy, tantivy, and halloo to the
dogs, upon which they turned about, supposing it to be some
brother sportsman, but seeing nobody, Worthy Sir swore the old
woman they had relieved was Carew; a servant therefore was
dispatched to bring her back; and she was brought into the parlour
among the gentlemen, where, being examined, she confessed herself
to be the famous Mr. Bampfylde-Moore Carew, which made the
gentlemen very merry, and they were now all employed in untying
the children from his back, and observing the features and dress
of this grandmother, which afforded them sufficient entertainment.
They afterwards rewarded our hero for the mirth he procured them.

In the same manner he raised a contribution of Mr. Jones, of
Ashton, near Bristol, twice in one day, who had maintained, with a
gentleman of his acquaintance, that he could not be so deceived.
In the morning, with a sooty face, leather apron, a dejected
countenance, and a woollen cap, he was generously relieved as an
unfortunate blacksmith, whose all had been consumed by fire: in
the afternoon he exchanged his legs for crutches; his countenance
was now pale and sickly, his gestures very expressive of pain, his
complaints lamentable, a poor unfortunate tinner, disabled from
maintaining himself, a wife, and seven children, by the damps and
hardships he had suffered in the mines; and so well did he paint
his distress, that the disabled tinner was now as generously
relieved as the unfortunate blacksmith had been in the morning.

Being now near the city of Bath, where he had not long before made
so great a figure with his new married bride, he was resolved to
visit it in a very different shape and character; he therefore
tied up one of his legs behind him, and supplied its place with a
wooden one, and putting on a false beard, assumed the character of
a poor old cripple. In this disguise he had an opportunity of
entertaining himself with the different receptions he met with
from every order of men now, from what he had done before in his
fine rich clothes. The rich, who before saluted him with their
hats and compliments, now spurned him out of their way; the
gamesters overlooked him, thinking he was no fish for their net;
the chairmen, instead of Please your honour, d—d him; and the
pumpers, who attentively marked his nod before, now denied him a
glass of water. Many of the clergy, those disciples of humility,
looked upon him with a supercilious brow; the ladies too, who had
before strove who should be his partner at the balls, could not
bear the sight of so shocking a creature: thus despised is poverty
and rags, though sometimes the veil of real merit; and thus
caressed and flattered is finery, though perhaps a covering for
shame, poverty of soul, and abandoned profligacy. One character
alone vouchsafed to look upon this contemptible object; the good
man looked upon him with an eye melting into tenderness and soft
compassion, while at the same time the hand which was stretched
out to relieve him, showed the heart felt all the pangs which it
supposed him to feel. But, notwithstanding the almost general
contempt, he raised very considerable contributions; for, as some
tossed him money out of pride, others to get rid of his
importunity, and a few, as above, out of a good heart, it amounted
to no small sum by the end of the season.

It is almost unnecessary to inform the reader, that these
successful stratagems gained him high applause and honour in the
company of the Gypsies: he soon became the favourite of their
king, who was very old and decrepit, and had always some
honourable mark of distinction assigned him at their public
assemblies. [Note: By favourite we do not mean a worthless
flatterer, but one who from real merit deserved the approbation of
his king.] These honours and applauses were so many fresh spurs to
his ingenuity and industry; so certain it is, that wherever those
qualities are honoured, and publicly rewarded, though but by an
oaken garland, there industry will outwork itself, and ingenuity
will exceed the common bounds of art. Our hero, therefore, was
continually planning new stratagems, and soon executed a very bold
one on his grace the Duke of Bolton. Coming to his seat near
Basingstoke, in Hampshire, he dressed himself in a sailor's ragged
habit, and knocking at the gate, desired of the porter, with a
composed and assured countenance, admittance to the duke, or at
least that the porter would give his grace a paper which he held
in his hand; but, as he did not apply in a proper manner to this
great officer, (who we think may not improperly be styled the
turnkey of the gate) as he did not show him that passport which
can open every gate, pass by the surliest porter, and get
admittance even to kings, neither himself nor paper could gain any
entrance. However, he was not disheartened with this, but waiting
near the gate for some time, he at last saw a servant come out,
whom he followed, and, telling him that he was a very unfortunate
man, desired he would be so kind as to introduce him where he
might speak to his grace. As this servant had no interest in
locking up his master, for that belonged to the porter only, he
very readily complied with his request, as soon as the porter was
off his stand; which he accordingly did, introducing him into a
hall, where the duke was to pass through soon. He had not been
long there before the duke came in, upon which he clapped his knee
to the ground, and very graciously offered a paper to his hand for
acceptance, which was a petition, setting forth that the
unfortunate petitioner, Bampfylde-Moore Carew, was supercargo of a
large vessel that was cast away coming from Sweden, in which were
his whole effects, and none of which he had been able to save. The
duke seeing the name of Bampfylde-Moore Carew, and knowing those
names to belong to families of the greatest worth and note in the
west of England, inquired of what family he was, and how he became
entitled to those honourable names? He replied, they were those of
his godfathers, the Honourable Hugh Bampfylde, and the Honourable
Major Moore. The duke then asked him several questions about his
friends and relations, all of which he answered very fully; and
the duke expressing some surprise that he should apply for relief
in his misfortunes to any but his own family, who were so well
able to assist him, he replied, he had disobliged them by some
follies in his youth, and had not seen them for some years, but
was now returning to them. Many more questions did the duke, and a
lady who was present, ask him; all of which he answered to their
satisfaction.

As this was not a great while after his becoming a member of the
community of the Gypsies, the duke had never heard that any of the
noble family of the Carews was become one of those people; and was
very glad to have it in his power to oblige any of that family; he
therefore treated him with respect, and called a servant to
conduct him into an inner room, where the duke's barber waited on
him to shave him. Presently after came in a footman, who brought
in a good suit of trimmed clothes, a fine Holland shirt, and all
the other parts of dress suitable to these. As soon as he had
finished dressing, he was introduced to the duke again, who
complimented him on his genteel appearance, and not without
reason, as few did more honour to dress. He was now desired to sit
down by the duke, with whom were many other persons of quality,
who were all greatly taken with his person and behaviour, and very
much condoled his misfortunes; so that a collection was soon made
for him to the amount of ten guineas. The duke, being engaged to
go out in the afternoon, desired him to stay there that night, and
gave orders that he should be handsomely entertained, leaving his
gentleman to keep him company; but Mr. Carew, probably not liking
his company so well as the duke's, took an opportunity, soon after
the duke was gone, to set out unobserved towards Basingstoke,
where he immediately went into a house which he knew was
frequented by some of his community. The master of the house, who
saw him entering the door, cried out, Here's his Grace the Duke of
Bolton coming in! upon which there was no small hurry amongst the
company. As soon as he entered, he ordered the liquor to flow very
plentifully at his private cost; his brethren discovering who he
was, were greatly amazed at the appearance he made, so different
from the usual custom of their order: but when he had informed
them fully of the bold stratagem he had executed, the whole place
resounded with applause, and every one acknowledged he was the
most worthy of succeeding their present good old king.

As our hero's thoughts were bent on making still greater advantage
of his stratagem, he did not stay long with his brethren, but went
to a reputable inn, where he lodged, and set out the next morning
for Salisbury; here he presented his petition to the mayor,
bishop, and other gentlemen of great note and fortune, (applying
to none but such who were so,) and acquainted them with the
favours he had received from his grace the Duke of Bolton. The
gentlemen, having such ocular demonstration of the duke's great
liberality, treated him with great complaisance and respect, and
relieved him very generously, not presuming to offer any small
alms to one whom the Duke of Bolton had thought so worthy of his
notice. In the same manner, and with the same success, he visited
Lord Arundel, Sir Edward Bouverie, and many other gentlemen in the
counties of Wilts, Dorset, and Somerset. Coming into Devonshire,
his native country, he visited all his friends and most intimate
acquaintance in that part, and was relieved by them, not one of
them discovering this unfortunate supercargo to be Mr. Bampfylde-
Moore Carew. Being one morning near the seat of his friend Sir
William Courtney, he was resolved to pay him three visits that
day: he went therefore to a house frequented by his order, and
there pulled off his fine clothes, and put on a parcel of rags; in
this dress he moved towards Sir William's: there, with a piteous
moan, a dismal countenance, and a deplorable tale, he got half-a-
crown of that gentleman, as a man who had met with misfortunes at
sea; at noon he put on a leather apron, a coat which seemed
scorched by the fire, with a dejected countenance applied again,
and was relieved as an unfortunate shoemaker, who had been burned
out of his house, and all he had; in the afternoon he went again
in his trimmed clothes, and desiring admittance to Sir William,
with a modest grace and submissive eloquence he repeated his
misfortunes as the supercargo of a vessel which had been cast
away, and his whole effects lost, at the same time mentioning the
kindness he had received from his grace the Duke of Bolton. Sir
William, seeing his genteel appearance and behaviour, treated him
with that respect which the truly great will always pay to those
who supplicate their assistance, and generously relieved him,
presenting him with a guinea at his departure. There happened to
be at that time a great number of the neighbouring gentlemen and
clergy at dinner with Sir William, not one of whom discovered who
this supercargo was, except the Reverend Mr. Richards, who did not
make it known till he was gone; upon which Sir William dispatched
a servant after him, to desire him to come back. When he entered
the room again, Sir William and the rest of the company were very
merry with him, and he was desired to sit down and give them an
account by what stratagem he had got all his finery, and what 
success he had with it, which he did; after which he asked Sir
William if he had not bestowed half-a-crown that morning on a
beggar, and at noon relieved a poor unfortunate shoemaker. I
remember, replied Sir William, that I bestowed such alms on a poor
ragged wretch. Well, said Mr. Carew, that ragged wretch was no
other than the supercargo now before you. Sir William scarcely
crediting this, Mr. Carew withdrew, and putting on the same rags,
came again with the same piteous moan, dismal countenance, and
deplorable tale, as he had done in the morning, which fully
convinced Sir William that he was the same man, and occasioned
much diversion in the company; he was however introduced again,
and seated among them in his rags; Sir William being one of the
few who pay a greater regard to the man than the dress, can
discern and support merit under rags, and despise poverty of soul
and worthlessness in embroidery; but, notwithstanding the success
of this stratagem, our hero always looked upon it as one of the
most unfortunate in his whole life; for, after he had been at Sir
William's, as above-mentioned, coming to Stoke Gabriel, near
Totness, on a Sunday, and having done that which discovered the
nakedness of Noah, he went to the Reverend Mr. Osburn, the
minister of the parish, and requested the thanksgivings of the
church for the wonderful preservation of himself, and the whole
ship's crew, in the imminent danger of a violent tempest of
thunder and lightning, which destroyed the vessel they were aboard
of. Though Mr. Osburn knew him very well, yet he had no suspicion
of its being him in disguise, therefore readily granted his
request; and not only so, but recommending him to his
parishioners, a handsome collection was made for him by the
congregation, which he had generosity enough to distribute among
the poor of the parish, reserving but a small part to himself.
Though this was bringing good out of evil, he still speaks of it
(after above thirty years lapse since the commission) with the
greatest regret and compunction of mind; for he is sensible, that
though he can deceive man, he cannot deceive God, whose eyes
penetrate into every place, and mark all our actions, and who is a
Being too awful to be jested with.


Chapter VII.
He is Crowned King of the Beggars

It was about this time the good old king of the mendicants, (under
which title we comprehend the community of the Gypsies, as well as
every other order of mendicants, vulgarly called beggars,) named
Clause Patch, well known in the city of London, and most parts of
England, finished a life of true glory, being spent in promoting
the welfare of his people. A little before his death, finding the
decays of nature increase every day, and his final dissolution
approach, he called together all his children, to the number of
eighteen, and summoned as many of his subjects as were within a
convenient distance, being willing that the last spark of his life
should go out in the service of his people; this summons was
obeyed with heavy hearts by his loving subjects, and, at the day
and place appointed, a great number assembled together.

The venerable old king was brought in a high chair, and placed in
the midst of them, his children standing next to him, and his
subjects behind them.—Reader, if thou hast ever seen that famous
picture of Seneca bleeding to death in the bath, with his friends
and disciples standing round him (a picture in the possession of
the earl of Exeter, at his seat near Stamford, in Lincolnshire,)
then mayest thou form some idea of this assembly: such was the
lively grief, such the profound veneration, such the solemn
attention that appeared in every countenance; but we can give thee
no adequate idea of the inward joy which the good old king felt at
his seeing such unfeigned marks of love in his subjects, which he
considered as so many testimonies of his own virtues; for, certain
it is that, when kings are fathers of their people, their subjects
will have for them more than the filial love or veneration of
sons. The mind of man cannot conceive anything so august, as that
of a king beloved by his subjects. Could kings but taste this
pleasure at their first mounting the throne, instead of drinking
of the intoxicating cup of power, we should see them considering
their subjects as children, and themselves the fathers, to
nourish, instruct, and provide for them as a flock, and themselves
the shepherds to bring them to pleasant pastures, refreshing
streams, and secure folds.—For some time the king of the
mendicants sat contemplating these emotions of his subjects, then
bending forward, thus addressed them:

"Children and friends, or rather may I call you all my children, 
as I regard you all with a parental love, I have taken you from
your daily employments, that you may all eat and drink with me
before I die. I am not courtier enough yet, however, to make my
favours an honest loss to my friends; but, before you depart, the
book shall be examined, and every one of you shall receive from my
privy purse, the same sum that you made by your business this day
of the last week. Let not this honest act of generosity displease
my heirs; it is the last waste I shall make of their stores: the
rest of what I die possessed of is theirs by right, but my
counsel, though directed to them only, shall be of public good to
all. The good success, my dear children, with which it has pleased
heaven to bless my industry in this our calling, has given me the
power of bestowing one hundred pounds on each of you, a small, but
improvable fortune, and of most use, as it is a proof that every
one of you may gain as much as the whole, if your own idleness or
vice prevent it not;—mark by what means! Our community, like
people of other professions, live upon the necessities, the
passions, or the weaknesses of their fellow-creatures. The two
great passions of the human breast are vanity and pity; both these
have great power in men's actions, but the first the greater far;
and he who can attract these the most successfully, will gain the
largest fortune.

"There was a time when rules for doing this were of more worth to
me than gold; but now I am grown old, my strength and senses fail
me, and I am past being an object of compassion. A real scene of
affliction moves few hearts to pity: dissembled wretchedness is
what most reaches the human mind, and I am past dissembling. Take
therefore among you, the maxims I have laid down for my own guide,
and use them with as much success as I have done.

"Be not less friends because you are brothers, or of the same
profession: the lawyers herd together in their inns, the doctors
in their college, the mercers on Ludgate-hill, and the old
clothes-men in Monmouth-street: what one has not among these
another has; and among you the heart of him who is not moved by
one lamentable object, will probably be so by another; and that
charity which was half awakened by the first, will relieve a
second, or a third. Remember this, and always people a whole
street with objects skilled in scenes of different distress,
placed at proper distances: the tale that moves not one heart, may
surprise the next,—the obdurate passer-by of the first must be
made of no human matter if he feels no part of the distress that
twenty different tales have heaped together; and be assured, that
where it is touched with a kindred misfortune, it will bestow.

"Remember, that where one gives out of pity to you, fifty give out
of kindness to themselves, to rid them of your troublesome
application; and for one that gives out of real compassion, five
hundred do it out of ostentation. On these principles, trouble
people most who are most busy, and ask relief where many see it
given, and you'll succeed in your attempt. Remember that the
streets were made for people to walk, and not to converse in: keep
up their ancient use; and whenever you see two or three gathered
together, be you amongst them, and let them not hear the sound of
their own voices till they have bought off the noise of yours.
When self-love is thus satisfied, remember social virtue is the
next duty, and tell your next friend where he may go and obtain 
the same relief, by the same means.

"Trouble not yourselves about the nobility: prosperity has made
them vain and insensible: they cannot pity what they cannot feel.

"The talkers in the street are to be tolerated on different
conditions, and at different prices; if they are tradesmen, their
conversation will soon end, and may be well paid for by a
halfpenny: if an inferior clings to the skirt of a superior, he
will give twopence rather than be pulled off; and when you are
happy enough to meet a lover and his mistress, never part with
them under sixpence, for you may be sure they will never part from
one another.

"So much regards communities of men; but when you hunt single, the
great game of all is to be played. However much you ramble in the
day, be sure to have some street near your home, where your chief
residence is, and all your idle time is spent, for the night. Here
learn the history of every family, and whatever has been the
latest calamity; of that provide a brother or a sister that may
pretend the same. If the master of one house has lost a son, let
your eldest brother attack his compassion on that tender side, and
tell him he has lost the sweetest, hopefullest, and dutifullest
child, that was his only comfort: what would the answer be, but,
aye, poor fellow! I know how to pity thee in that; and a shilling
be in as much haste to fly out of his pocket as the first tear
from his eye.

"Is the master of a second house sick, waylay his wife from
morning till night, and tell her you will pray, morning, noon, and
night for his recovery. If he dies, grief is the reigning passion
for the first fortnight, let him have been what he would: grief
leads naturally to compassion, so let your sister thrust a pillow
under her coats, tell her she is a poor disconsolate widow, left
with seven small children, and that she lost the best husband in
the world; and you may share considerable gains.

"Whatever people seem to want, give it them largely in your 
address to them: call the beau sweet gentleman, bless even his
coat or periwig, and tell him they are happy ladies where he is
going. If you meet with a schoolboy-captain, such as our streets
are full of, call him noble general; and if the miser can be any
way got to strip himself of a farthing, it will be by the name of
charitable sir.

"Some people show you in their looks the whole thoughts of their
heart, and give you a fine notice how to succeed with them: if you
meet a sorrowful countenance with a red coat, be sure the wearer
is a disbanded officer: let a female always attack him, and tell
him she is the widow of a poor marine, who had served twelve
years, and then broke his heart because he was turned out without
a penny; if you see a plain man hang down his head as he comes out
of some nobleman's gate, say to him, Good worthy sir, I beg your
pardon, but I am a poor ruined tradesman, that once was in a good
business, but the great people would not pay me. And if you see a
pretty woman with a dejected look, send your sister that is at
hand, to complain to her of a bad husband, that gets drunk and
beats her; that runs to whores, and has spent all her substance:
there are but two things that can make a handsome woman 
melancholy: the having a bad husband, or the having no husband at
all; if the first of these is the case, one of the former crimes
will touch her to the quick, and loosen the strings of her purse;
in the other, let a second distressed object tell her she was to
have been married well, but that her lover died a week before; one
way or other the tender heart of the female will be melted, and
the reward will be handsome. If you meet a homely, but dressed-up
lady, pray for her lovely face, and beg a penny; if you see a mark
of delicacy by the drawing up of the nose, send somebody to show
her a sore leg, a scalded head, or a rupture. If you are happy
enough to fall in with a tender husband leading his big wife to
church, send companions that have but one arm, or two thumbs, or
tell her of some monstrous child you have brought forth, and the
good man will pay you to be gone, if he gives slightly, it is but
following, getting before the lady, and talking louder, and you
may depend upon his searching his pocket to better purpose a
second time. There are many more things of which I have to speak,
but my feeble tongue will not hold out. Profit by these: they will
be found sufficient, and if they prove to you, my children, what
they have been to me these eighteen years, I shall not repine at
my dissolution."

Here he paused for some time, being almost spent: then, recovering
his voice and spirits, he thus began again: "As I find the lamp of
life is not quite extinguished, I shall employ the little that
remains in saying a few words of my public conduct as your king. I
call heaven to witness, that I have loved you all with a paternal
love: these now feeble limbs and broken spirits have been worn out
in providing for your welfare, and often have these dim eyes
watched while you have slept, with a father's care for your
safety. I call you all to witness that I have kept an impartial
register of your actions, and no merit has passed unnoticed. I
have, with a most exact hand, divided to every man his due portion
of our common stock, and have had no worthless favourite nor
useless officer to eat the honey of your labour. And for all these
I have had my reward, in seeing the happiness, and having the love
of all my subjects. I depart, therefore, in peace, to rest from my
labours; it remains only that I give you my last advice, which is,
that in choosing my successor, you pay no partial regard to my
family, but let him only that is most worthy rule over you." He
said no more, but, leaning back in his chair, died without a sigh.

Never was there a scene of more real distress, or more unfeigned
grief, than now appeared among his children and subjects. Nothing
was heard but sighs and exclamations for their loss. When the
first transports of their grief were over, they sent the sorrowful
news to all the houses that were frequented by their community in
every part of the kingdom; at the same time summoning them to
repair to the city of London on a certain day, in order to proceed
to the election of a new king.

Before the day appointed for the election a vast concourse of
mendicants flocked from all parts of the kingdom to the city of
London; for every member of the community has a right to vote in
the choice of their king, as they think it inconsistent with that
of natural liberty, which every man is born heir to, to deny
anyone the privilege of making his own choice in a matter of so
great importance.

Here, reader, as thou wilt be apt to judge from what thou hast
seen, thou already expectest a scene of riot and debauchery; to
see the candidates servilely cringing, meanly suing, and basely
bribing the electors, depriving themselves of sense and reason,
and selling more than Esau did for a mess of pottage; for, what is
birthright, what is inheritance, when put in the scale against
that choicest blessing, public liberty! O, Liberty! thou enlivener
of life, thou solace of toils, thou patron of virtue, thou
encourager of industry, thou spring of justice, thou something
more than life, beyond the reach of fancy to describe, all hail!
It is thou that beamest the sunshine in the patriot's breast; it
is thou that sweetenest the toil of the labouring mechanic! thou
dost inspire the ploughman with his jocund mirth, and thou tunest
the merry milk-maid's song; thou canst make the desert smile, and
the barren rock to sing for joy; by thy sacred protection the
poorest peasant lies secure under the shadow of his defenceless
cot, whilst oppression at a distance gnashes with her teeth, but
dares not show her iron rod; and power, like the raging billows,
dashes its bounds with indignation, but dares not overpass them.
But where thou art not, how changed the scene! how tasteless, how
irksome labour! how languid industry! Where are the beauteous
rose, the gaudy tulip, the sweet-scented jessamine? where the
purple grape, the luscious peach, the glowing nectarine? wherefore
smile not the valleys with their beauteous verdure, nor sing for
joy with their golden harvest? All are withered by the scorching
sun of lawless power! Where thou art not, what place so sacred as
to be secure? or who can say, this is my own! This is the language
only of the place where thou delightest to dwell; but, as soon as
thou spreadest thy wings to some more pleasing clime, power walks
abroad with haughty strides, and tramples upon the weak, whilst
oppression, with its heavy hand, bows down the unwilling neck to
the yoke.—O, my Country! alas, my Country! thou wast once the
chosen seat of liberty; her footsteps appeared in thy streets, thy
palaces, thy public assemblies: she exulted in thee: her voice,
the voice of joy and gladness was heard throughout the land: with
more than a mother's love she held forth her seven-fold shield to
protect thee, the meanest of her sons; whilst justice, supported
by law, rode triumphant by her side with awful majesty, and looked
into fear and trembling every disturber of the public quiet. O,
thou whom my soul loveth, wherefore dost thou sit dejected, and
hidest thy face all the day long?—Canst thou ask the reason of my
grief? See, see, my generous hardy sons are become foolish,
indolent, effeminate, thoughtless; behold, how with their own
hands they have loaded me with shackles: alas! hast thou not seen
them take the rod from my beloved sister, Justice, and give it to
the sons of blood and rapine? Yet a little while I mourn over lost
and degenerate sons, and then with hasty flight fix my habitation
in some more happy clime.

Though the community of the Gypsies at other times give themselves
up to mirth and jollity with perhaps too much licence, yet nothing
is reckoned more infamous and shameful amongst them than to appear
intoxicated during the time of an election, and it very rarely
happens that any of them are so, for they reckon it a choice of so
much importance, that they cannot exert in it too much judgment,
prudence, and wisdom; they therefore endeavour to have their
faculties strong, lively, penetrating, and clear at that time.
Their method of election is different from that of most other
people, though, perhaps, it is the best contrived of any, and
attended with the fewest inconveniences. We have already observed,
that none but those who have long been members of the community,
are well acquainted with the institution of it, and have
signalized themselves by some remarkable actions, are permitted to
offer themselves as candidates. These are obliged, ten days before
the election, to fix up in some place of their public resort an
account of those actions, upon the merit of which they found their
pretensions of becoming candidates; to which they must add their
opinions on liberty, and the office and duties of a king. They
must, during these ten days, appear every day at the place of
election, that their electors may have an opportunity of forming
some judgment from the lineaments and prognostics of their
countenance. A few days before the election, a little white ball,
and as many black ones as with the white one will equal the number
of candidates, are given to each elector.

When the day of election is come, as many boxes are placed as
there are candidates, with the name of the particular candidate
written on the box which is appropriated to him; these boxes are
quite closed, except a little opening at the top, which is every
night, during the election, locked up under the keys and seals of
each candidate, and of six of the most venerable old men in the
community; it is in the little opening at the top of these boxes,
that the elector puts in the little ball we have just now
mentioned; at the same time he puts his white ball into the box of
the candidate whom he chooses to be his king, he puts a black ball
into the boxes of all the other candidates; and when they have all
done so, the boxes are broken open, and the balls counted in
presence of all the candidates, and of as many electors as choose
it, by the old men above mentioned; and he who has the greatest
number of white balls is always duly chosen. By this means no
presiding officer has it in his power to make one more than two,
which sometimes happens in the elections amongst other
communities, who do not use this form. There are other innumerable
advantages attending this manner of election, and it is likely to
preserve public liberty the longest; for, first, as the candidates
are obliged to fix up publicly an account of those actions upon
the merit of which they become candidates, it deters any but those
who are truly worthy from offering themselves; and, as the
sentiments which each of them gives upon public liberty, and the
duty and office of a king, is immediately entered in their public
register, it stands as a public witness against, and a check upon
that candidate who is chosen, to deter him from a change of
sentiments and principles; for, though in some countries this is
known to have little effect, and men have on a sudden, without any
alteration in the nature of things, shamelessly espoused those
principles and sentiments, which they had vehemently all their
life before opposed, yet in this community, where there is so high
a sense of honour and shame kept up, it must necessarily be none
of the least binding obligations. Secondly, by this method of
balloting, or giving their votes by balls, the elector's choice is
more free and unbiassed; for, as none but himself can know the
candidate he gives his white ball to, there can be no influence of
fear, interest, ties of blood, or any other cause, to oblige him
to give his vote contrary to his judgment; even bribes, if they
were known amongst these people, would lose their effect under 
this method of voting; because few candidates would choose to
bribe, when they could have no security or knowledge whether the
bribed elector might have put a black ball instead of a white one
into his box.

Our hero was now one of the candidates, and exhibited to the
electors so long a list of bold and ingenious stratagems which he
had executed, and made so graceful and majestic an appearance in
his person, that he had a considerable majority of white balls in
his box, though there were ten candidates for the same honour;
upon which he was declared duly elected, and hailed by the whole
assembly, King of the Mendicants. The public register of their
actions being immediately committed to his care, and homage done
him by all the assembly, the whole concluded with great feasting
and rejoicing, and the electors sang the following ode:

I.
Cast your nabs [caps] and cares away,
This is Maunders' holiday;
In the world look out and see,
Where so blest a king as he!

II.
At the crowning of our king,
Thus we ever dance and sing;
Where's the nation lives so free,
And so merrily as we!

III.
Be it peace, or be it war,
Here at liberty we are:
Hang all Harmenbecks, [constables] we cry,
We the Cuffin Queres [Justices of teh peace] defy.

IV.
We enjoy our ease and rest,
To the field we are not press'd;
And when taxes are increased,
We are not a penny sess'd.

V.
Nor will any go to law
With a Maunder [beggar] for a straw;
All which happiness, he brags,
Is only owing to his rags.


Chapter VIII
Not resting on His Authority, He Continues his
Career

Though Mr. Carew was now privileged by the dignity of his office
from going out on any cruise, and was provided with everything
necessary, by joint contributions of the community, yet he did not
give himself up to the slow poison of the mind, indolence, which,
though its operations are imperceptible, is more hurtful and fatal
than any of the quicker passions; for we often see great virtues
break through the cloud of other vices, but indolence is a
standing corrupted pool, which always remains in the same state,
unfit for every purpose. Our hero, therefore, notwithstanding the
particular privilege of his office, was as active in his
stratagems as ever, and ready to encounter any difficulties which
seemed to promise success, of which the following is an instance.

Happening to be in the parish of Fleet, near Portland Race, in
Dorsetshire, he happened to hear in the evening of a ship in
imminent danger of being cast away, she having been driven on some
shoals. Early in the morning, before it was well light, he pulled
off his clothes, which he flung into a deep pit, and then unseen
by anyone swam to the vessel, which now parted asunder; he found
only one of the crew alive, who was hanging by his hands on the
side of the vessel, the rest being either washed overboard, or
drowned in attempting to swim to the shore. Never was there a more
piteous object than this poor wretch hanging between life and
death; Mr. Carew immediately offered him his assistance to get him
to shore, at the same time inquiring the name of the vessel, and
her master, what cargo on board, whence she came, and whither
bound.

The poor wretch replied, she belonged to Bristol, captain Griffin,
master, came from Hamburg, was bound to Bristol with a cargo of
Hamburg goods, and had seven men and a boy on board; at the same
time our hero was pressing him to let go his hold, and commit
himself to his care, and he would endeavour to swim with him to
shore: but, when the danger is so imminent, and death stands
before our eyes, it is no easy matter to be persuaded to quit the
weakest stay; thus the poor wretch hesitated so long before he
would quit his hold of the vessel, that a large sea broke upon the
wreck, and overwhelmed him in the great deep. Mr. Carew was in no
little danger, but, being an excellent swimmer, he with great
difficulty got to shore, though not without hurt, the sea throwing
him with great violence on the beach, whereby one of his arms was
wounded. By this time a great number of spectators were gathered
on the strand, who rejoiced to see Mr. Carew come ashore alive,
supposing him to be one of the poor wretches belonging to the
ship. Naked, spent with fatigue, and wounded, he raised a feeling
of pity in all the spectators; for, so strongly is this tender
passion connected with our frame by the beneficent Author of
Nature, to promote the assistance of each other, that, no sooner
does the eye see a deplorable object, than the heart feels it, and
as quickly forces the hand to relieve it; so that those whom the
love of money, for we think that the greatest opposite to pity,
has rendered unfeeling of another's woes, are said to have no
hearts, or hearts of stone; as we naturally conclude no one can be
void of that soft and Godlike passion—pity, but either one who by
some cause or other happens to be made up without a heart, or one
in whom continual droppings of self-love or avarice have quite
changed the nature of it; which, by the most skilful anatomist, is
allowed in its natural state to be fleshy, soft, and tender; but
has been found, without exception, upon inspection into the bodies
of several money-lovers, to be nothing but a callous stony
substance, from which the chemists, by most intense fires, have
been able to extract nothing but a caput mortuum, or an earthy,
dry, useless powder.

Amongst the spectators of Mr. Carew, was the housekeeper of Madam
Mohun, in the parish of Fleet, who had a heart made of the softest
substance; for she immediately, agreeable to the beneficent
precepts of the gospel, pulled off her own cloak to give to him
that had none: and, like the good Samaritan, giving him a
handkerchief to bind up his wounds, bid him follow her, and led
him to her mistress's house, where, placing him before a good
fire, she gave him two large glasses of brandy, with loaf sugar in
it; then bringing him a shirt and other apparel, she went upstairs
and acquainted Madam Mohun, her venerable mistress, in the most
feeling manner, with the whole affair.

Here, could we hope our work would last to future ages, we might
immortalize this generous woman.—Her mistress was so affected with
her relation, that she immediately ordered a warm bed to be
prepared for the poor wretch, and that he should be taken great
care of, which was accordingly soon done, and Mr. Carew lay very
quiet for three or four hours; then waking, he seemed to be very
much disturbed in his mind; his talk was incoherent, his groans
moving, and he tossed from one side of the bed to the other, but
seemed to find ease in none: the good people seeing him so uneasy
in bed, brought him a good suit of clothes, and he got up. Being
told the bodies of some of his shipmates were flung up by the sea
on the shore, he seemed greatly affected, and the tears dropped
from his eyes. Having received from Justice Farwell, who happened
to be there, ill of the gout, a guinea and a pass for Bristol, and
considerable contributions from the great number of people who
flocked to see him, to the amount of nine or ten pounds, he
expressed an inclination of making the best of his way to Bristol:
and the good Justice Farwell lent him his own horse to ride as far
as the town of Dorchester, and the parson of the parish sent his
man to show him the way.

Mr. Carew would have been gladly excused from going through
Dorchester, as he had appeared there but four or five days before
in the character of a broken miller, and had thereby raised a
contribution of the mayor and corporation of that place; but as it
lay in the direct road to Bristol, and he was attended by a guide,
he could not possibly avoid it. As soon as they came there, his
guide presented the pass in behalf of Mr. Carew to the mayor, who
thereupon ordered the town-bell to be rung, and assembled the
heads of the corporation. Though he had been so lately with them,
yet, being now in a quite different dress, and a pass which they
knew to be signed by Justice Farwell, and the guide testifying
that he was an unfortunate shipwrecked seaman, escaped from the
most imminent danger, they had no notion of his being the broken
miller who had been with them a few days before; they therefore
treated him with great humanity, and relieved him very generously.
After this, the guide took his leave of him with a great many good
wishes for his safe arrival at Bristol; but Mr. Carew, instead of
pursuing his way thither, steered his course towards Devonshire,
and raised contributions by the way, as a shipwrecked seaman, on
Colonel Brown of Framton, Squire Trenchard, and Squire Falford of
Tolla, Colonel Broadrip, Colonel Mitchell, and Squire Richards of
Long Britty, and several other gentlemen.

It was not long after this, that, being in the city of Bristol, he
put in execution a very bold and ingenious stratagem. Calling to
mind one Aaron Cock, a trader of considerable worth and note, at
St. John's in Newfoundland, whom he resembled both in person and
speech, he resolved to be the son of Aaron Cock for some time; he
therefore went upon the Tolsey, and other places of public resort
for the merchants of Bristol, and there modestly acquainted them
with his name, as well as his misfortunes; that he was born and
lived all his life at St. John's in Newfoundland; that he was
bound for England, in the Nicholas, Captain Newman; which vessel
springing a leak, they were obliged to quit her, and were taken up
by an Irishman, Patrick Pore, and by him carried into Waterford;
whence he had got passage, and landed at King's Road; that his
business in England was to buy provisions and fishing craft, and
to see his relations, who lived in the parish of Cockington, near
Torbay, where, he said, his father was born. The Captains Elton,
Galloway, Masters, Thomas, Turner, and several other Newfoundland
traders, many of whom personally knew his pretended father and
mother, asked him many questions about the family, their usual
place of fishing, &c., particularly if he remembered how the
quarrel happened at his father's (when he was but a boy) which was
of so unhappy a consequence to Governor Collins? Mr. Carew very
readily replied, that though he was then very young, he remembered
that the governor, the parson and his wife, Madam Short, Madam
Bengy, Madam Brown, and several other women of St. John's, having
met together, and feasting at his father's, a warm dispute
happened among the men in the heat of liquor, concerning the
virtue of women, the governor obstinately averring that there was
not one honest woman in all Newfoundland. What think you then of
my wife? said the parson. The same as I do of all other women, all
whores alike, answered the governor roughly. Hereupon the women,
not able to bear this gross aspersion on their honour, with one
accord attacked the governor, who, being overpowered by their
fury, could not defend his face from being disfigured by their
nails, nor his clothes from being torn off his back; and what was
much worse, the parson's wife thinking herself most injured, cut
the hamstring of his leg with a knife, which rendered him a
cripple his whole life after.

This circumstantial account, which was in every point exactly as
the affair happened, and many other questions concerning the
family which the captains asked him, and he as readily answered,
(having got every particular information concerning them when in
Newfoundland,) fully convinced them that he must really be the son
of their good old friend Mr. Aaron Cock; they therefore not only
very generously relieved him, but offered to lend him any moderate
sum, to be paid again in Newfoundland, the next fishing season;
but Mr. Carew had too high a sense of honour to abuse their
generosity so far; he therefore excused himself from accepting
their offer, by saying he would be furnished with as much as he
should have occasion for, by merchant Pemm of Exeter. They then
took him with them to Guildhall, recommending him to the
benevolence of the mayor and corporation, testifying he was a man
of reputable family in Newfoundland. Here a very handsome
collection was made for him; and the circumstances of his
misfortunes becoming public, many other respectable ladies and
gentlemen gave him that assistance according to their abilities,
which is always due to unfortunate strangers. Three days did the
captains detain him by their civilities in Bristol, showing him
all the curiosities and pleasures of the place to divert his
melancholy. He then set out for Cockington, where his relations
lived, and Bridgewater being on his road, he had a letter, from
one of the Bristol captains, to Captain Drake in that place. As
soon as he came to Bridgewater, he went directly to the mayor's
house, and knocking at the gate, it was opened to him by madam
mayoress, to whom he related his misfortune; and the good lady,
pitying him as an unfortunate stranger, so far distant from his
home, gave him half-a-crown, and engaged her daughter, a child, to
give him a shilling. We cannot pass by this amiable lady, without
paying her the due tribute of praise; for tenderness and
compassion ought to be the peculiar ornament of every female
breast; and it were to be wished that every parent would betimes,
like this good lady, instil into their children a tender sense of
humanity, and feeling for another's woes, they would by this means 
teach them the enjoyment of the most godlike and pleasing of all
other pleasures, that of relieving the distressed; and would
extinguish that sordid selfish spirit, which is the blot of
humanity. The good lady not content with what she had already 
done, ushered him into the room, where her husband, an aged
gentleman, was writing; to whom she related Mr. Cook's misfortunes
in as moving a manner as she was able; the old gentleman laid
aside his spectacles, and asked him several questions, then
dispatched his servant into the town, who soon returned with two
Newfoundland captains, one of whom happened to be Captain Drake,
to whom our hero had a letter of recommendation given him by one
of the Bristol captains; and the other Captain Morris, whose
business having called him to Bristol, he had there been already
informed by the captains of the circumstances of Mr. Cock's
misfortunes; and he repeating the same now to the mayor, Captain
Morris confirmed this relation, told them how he had been treated
at Bristol, and made him a present of a guinea and a greatcoat, it
being then very rainy weather; Captain Drake likewise gave him a
guinea, for both these gentlemen perfectly well knew Mr. Cook's
father and mother; the mayor likewise made him a present, and
entertained him very hospitably in his house. In the same
character he visited Sir Haswell Tent, and several other
gentlemen, raising considerable contributions.

Chapter IX
He is Imprisoned and Transported to Maryland, but
Escapes


This activity and ingenuity of their new king was highly agreeable
to the community of the mendicants, and his applauses resounded at
all their meetings; but, as fortune delights to change the scene,
and of a sudden to depress those she had most favoured, we come
now to relate the misfortunes of our hero, though we know not
whether we should call them by that name or not, as they gave him
a large field of action, and greater opportunities of exercising
the more manly virtues—courage and intrepidity in dangers.

Going one day to pay a visit to Mr. Robert Incledon, at Barnstaple
in Devon, (in an ill hour which his knowledge could not foresee,)
knocking at the door softly, it was, opened to him by the clerk,
with the common salutation of How do you do, Mr. Carew? where have
you been? He readily replied, that he was making a visit to Squire
Bassar, and in his return had called to pay his respects to Mr.
Incledon.

The clerk very civilly asked him to walk in; but no sooner had he
entered than the door was shut upon him by Justice Leithbridge, a
very bitter enemy to the whole community of mendicants, who
concealed himself behind it, and Mr. Carew was made a prisoner;—so
sudden are the vicissitudes of life; and misfortunes spring as it
were out of the earth.

Thus suddenly and unexpectedly fell the mighty Caesar, the master
of the world; and just so affrighted Priam looked when the shade
of Hector drew his curtains, and told him that his Troy was taken.

The reader will, undoubtedly, be at a loss to comprehend why he
was thus seized upon, contrary to the laws of hospitality; it is
therefore our business to inform him, that he had, some time
before this, in the shape of a poor lame cripple, frightened
either the justice or his horse on Hilton bridge; but which of the
two it was, cannot be affirmed with any certainty. However, the
justice vowed a dire revenge, and now exulted greatly at having
got him in his power; fame had no sooner sounded with her hundred
prattling tongues that our hero was in captivity, but the
justice's house was crowded with intercessors for him:—however,
Justice Leithbridge was deaf to all, and even to the entreaties of
beauty,—several ladies being likewise advocates for him; whether
it was that the justice was past that age when love shoots his
darts with most success, or whether his heart was always made of
that unmalleable stuff which is quite unassailable by love, or by
his cousin-german, pity, we cannot well determine.

Amongst the rest who came to see him, were some captains of
collier vessels, whom the justice espying, very probably taking
some disgust at their countenances, demanded who they were, and
immediately discharging the guard which had been before placed
over Mr. Carew, charged the captains with the care of him, though
they affirmed their vessels were to sail the next tide; however
the justice paying as little regard to their allegations as he had
done to their petitions for Mr. Carew, they found they had no
other hope but from the good-natured dame Patience; a good woman,
who is always ready to render our misfortunes less, and was, in
all his adventures, a great friend to our hero.

At length a warrant was made out for conveying him to Exeter, and
lodging him in one of the securest places in that city; but, as it
was now too late to set forward on their journey that night, they
were ordered to a public house at Barnstaple; and the justice
remembering the old proverb, fast bind, fast find, would fain have
locked the door of the room where Mr. Carew was, and taken the key
with him; but the honest landlord offering to become security for
his appearance in the morning, the justice was at last persuaded
to be content without a jailor.

Mr. Carew, notwithstanding his situation, was not cast down, but
bravely opposed his ill fortune with his usual courage, and passed
the night with great cheerfulness in the company of the collier
captains, who were his guard.

The next day Mr. Carew was conduct to Exeter, without anything
remarkable happening on the road; here, to his great annoyance, he
was securely lodged for upwards of two months, before he was
brought to trial at the quarter sessions, held at the castle, when
Justice Bevis was chairman; but that awful appearance,

The judges all met—a terrible show!

did not strike any terror into his breast; though loaded with
chains, he preserved his usual firmness of mind, and saluted the
court with a noble assurance. Being asked by the chairman what
parts of the world he had been in? he answered Denmark, Sweden,
Muscovy, France, Spain, Portugal, Newfoundland, Ireland, Wales,
and some parts of Scotland. The chairman then told him he must
proceed to a hotter country: he inquired into what climate, and
being told Merryland, he with great composure made a critical
observation on the pronunciation of that word, implying, that he
apprehended it ought to be pronounced Maryland, and added, it
would save him five pounds for his passage, as he was very
desirous of seeing that country: but, notwithstanding, he with
great resolution desired to know by what law they acted, as he was
not accused of any crime; however, sentence of banishment was
passed upon him for seven years; but his fate was not singular,
for he had the comfort of having fellow companions enough in his
unmerited sufferings, as, out of thirty-five prisoners, thirty-two
were ordered into the like banishment.—Whether at that period of
time mankind were more profligate than usual, or whether there was
a more than ordinary demand for men in his majesty's colonies,
cannot by us be determined.

Mr. Carew was not, as is most commonly the case, deserted by his
friends in adversity, for he was visited during the time of his
imprisonment by many gentlemen, who were exceedingly liberal to
him; and no sooner did the news of his captivity reach the ears of
his subjects, than they flocked to him from all parts,
administered to his necessities in prison, and daily visited him
till his departure.

This, and the thoughts of the many new scenes and adventures which
he was likely to encounter, whereby he might have an opportunity
of making his name as famous in America as it was already in
Europe, often filled his mind with too-pleasing reflections to
regret his fate, though he could have liked to have performed the
voyage under more agreeable circumstances; whenever the thought of
being cruelly separated from his beloved wife and daughters
glanced on his mind, the husband and father unmanned the hero, and
melted him into tenderness and fear; the reflection too of the
damage his subjects might sustain by his absence, and the disorder
the whole community would be put in by it, filled him with many
disquietudes. Thus, between pleasing ideas and heartfelt pangs,
did he pass his time till the day arrived that he was to be
conducted on board the Julian, Captain Froade, commander. But how,
gentle reader, shall I describe the ceremony of parting—the last
farewell of that dreadful day!

Leaving the reader, therefore, to suppose all these fine things,
behold the sails already spread, and the vessel cutting the waves;
but, as if fate had opposed itself to the banishment of our hero,
the winds soon proved contrary, and they were obliged to stay more
than a fortnight in Falmouth harbour for a fair wind, and from
thence were in eleven weeks in their passage to Maryland.

The first place they touched at was Hampton, between Cape Charles
and Cape Henry, where the captain went on shore and got a pilot;
and after about two days stay there, the pilot brought the vessel
down Mile's River, and cast anchor in Talbot county, when the
captain ordered a gun to be fired as a signal for the planters to
come down, and then went ashore. He soon after sent on board a
hogshead of rum, and ordered all the men prisoners to be close
shaved against the next morning, and the women to have their best 
head-dresses put on, which occasioned no little hurry on board;
for, between the trimming of beards, and putting on of caps, all
hands were fully employed. Early in the morning the captain
ordered public notice to be given of the day of sale; and the
prisoners, who were pretty near a hundred, were all ordered upon
deck, where a large bowl of punch was made, and the planters
flocked on board; their first inquiry was for letters from old
England, what passage he had, how their friends did, and the like.
The captain informed them of the war being declared against Spain,
that it was expected it would soon be declared against France; and
that he had been eleven weeks and four days in his passage. Their
next inquiry was, if the captain had brought them good store of
joiners, carpenters, blacksmiths, weavers, and tailors; upon which
the captain called out one Griffy, a tailor, who had lived at
Chumleigh, in the county of Devon, and was obliged to take a
voyage to Maryland, for making too free with his neighbour's
sheep. Two planters, who were Parson Nicholas and Mr. Rolls, asked
him if he was sound wind and limb? and told him it would be worse
for him if he told them an untruth; and at last purchased him from
the captain. The poor tailor cried and bellowed like a bell-
wether, cursing his wife who had betrayed him. Mr. Carew, like a
brave man, to whom every soil is his own country, ashamed of his
cowardice, gave the tailor to the devil; and, as he knew he could
not do without them, sent his shears, thimble, and needle, to bear
him company. Wherefore all these wailings? said our hero: have we
not a fine country before us? pointing to the shore. And indeed in
this he was very right, for Maryland not only affords everything
which preserves and confirms health, but also all things that are
charming. The beauty of the prospect, the fragrancy of the fields
and gardens, the brightness of the sky, and the serenity of the
air, affect the ravished senses; the country being a large plain,
and hills in it so easy of ascent, and of such a moderate height,
that they seem rather an artificial ornament to it, than one of
the accidents of nature. The abundance of rivers and brooks is no
little help to the fertility of the soil.

But to return.—When all the best tradesmen were bought up, a
planter came to Mr. Carew, and asked him what trade he was of. Mr.
Carew, to satisfy him of his usefulness, told him he was a rat-
catcher, a mendicant, and a dog merchant. What the d—l trades are
these? inquired the planter in astonishment; for I have never
before heard of them: upon which the captain thinking he should
lose the sale of him, takes the planter aside, and tells him he
did but jest, being a man of humour, for that he was a great
scholar, and was only sent over on account of having disobliged
some gentlemen; that he had no indenture with him, but he should
have him for seven years, and that he would make an excellent
school-master; however, no purchase was made of him. The next day
the captain asked him to go on shore with him to see the country,
but with a view of getting a purchaser for him among the planters.
As they were walking, several people came up to Mr. Carew, and
asked him what countryman he was, &c. At length they went to a
tavern, where one Mr. David Huxter, who was formerly of Lyme in
Dorset, and Mr. Hambleton, a Scotchman, seemed to have an
inclination to buy him between them; soon after came in one Mr.
Ashcraft, who put in for him too, and the bowl of punch went
merrily round. In the midst of their mirth, Mr. Carew, who had
given no consent to the bargain they were making for him, thought
it no breach of honour or good manners to seize an opportunity of
slipping away without taking leave of them; and taking away with
him about a pint of brandy and some biscuit cakes, which by good
luck he chanced to put his hand on, he immediately betook himself
to the woods as the only place of security for him.

Mr. Carew, having found he had eluded their search, congratulated
himself on his happy escape and deliverance; for he now made no
doubt of getting to old England again, notwithstanding the
difficulties which lay in his way, as he knew his courage was
equal to every danger; but we are too often apt, as the proverb
says, to reckon without our host, and are sometimes near danger
when we think ourselves most secure: and so it happened to our
hero at this time; for, amidst his joyful reflections, he did not
know that none were allowed to travel there, unless when known,
without proper passes, of which he was not provided; and there is
moreover a reward of 5l. for anyone who apprehends a runaway; it
therefore happened, that one morning early, passing through a
narrow path, he was met by four timbermen, going to work; he would
fain have escaped their observation, but they soon hailed him, and
demanded where he was going, and where his pass was? These were
questions which he would willingly have been excused from
answering; however, as his wit was always ready, he immediately
told them he belonged to the Hector privateer, (which he knew then
lay upon the coast,) and that he was going on some business for
the captain to Charles county; but, as he could produce no pass,
this would not satisfy them, so they seized upon him, and
conducted him to one Colonel Brown's, a justice of the peace in
Anne Arundel county.—But here, most gentle reader, that thou
mayest not form a wrong idea of this justice, and, as is too often
the case, judge of what thou hast not seen, from what thou hast
seen, it will be necessary to inform thee, that he was not such a
one as Hudibras describes:

An <z> old dull sot, who told the clock
For many years at Bridewell-dock,
At Westminster, and Hicks's-Hall,
And Hiccius Doccius play'd in all;
Where, in all governments and times,
Had been both friend and foe to crimes,
And used two equal ways of gaining
By hindering justice or maintaining;

Neither was he such a one as that excellent artist, Mr. Hogarth,
has depicted in his picture of a Modern Midnight Conversation; nor
such a one as the author of Joseph Andrews has, above all authors,
so inimitably drawn to the life; nor yet was he such a one as thou
hast often seen at a quarter sessions, with a large wig, a heavy
unmeaning countenance, and a sour aspect, who gravely nods over a
cause, and then passes a decision on what he does not understand;
and no wonder, when he, perhaps, never saw, much less read the
laws of his country; but of Justice Brown, I can assure the
reader, he could not only read, but upon occasion write a
mittimus, without the assistance of his clerk; he was thoroughly
acquainted with the general duties of his office, and the
particular laws of Maryland; his countenance was an awful majesty,
tempered with a humane sweetness, ever unwilling to punish, yet
always afraid of offending justice; and if at any time necessity
obliged him to use the rod, he did it with so much humanity and
compassion, as plainly indicated the duties of his office forced,
rather than the cruelty or haughtiness of his temper prompted to
it; and while the unhappy criminal suffered a corporeal
punishment, he did all that lay in his power, to the end that it
might have a due effect, by endeavouring to amend the mind with
salutary advice; if the exigencies of the state required taxes to
be levied upon the subjects, he never, by his authority or office,
excused himself from bearing his full proportion; nor even would
he meanly submit to see any of his fellow-justices do so.


Chapter X
He is Captured again and Suffers Grievously for
his Sense of Honour

It was before such a justice Mr. Carew had the good fortune to be
carried: they found him in his court-yard, just mounting his horse
to go out, and he very civilly inquired their business; the
timbermen told him they had got a runaway: the justice then
inquired of Mr. Carew who he was: he replied he was a sea-faring
man, belonging to the Hector privateer of Boston, captain
Anderson, and as they could not agree, he had left the ship. The
justice told him he was very sorry it should happen so, but he was
obliged by the laws of his country to stop all passengers who
could not produce passes; and, therefore, though unwillingly, he
should be obliged to commit him; he then entertained him very
plentifully with victuals and drink, and in the meantime made his
commitment for New Town gaol. Mr. Carew, finding his commitment
made, told the timbermen, that, as they got their money easily, he
would have a horse to ride upon, for it was too hot for him to
walk in that country. The justice merrily cried, Well spoken,
prisoner. There was then a great ado with the timbermen to get a
horse for him; but at last one was procured, and our hero, mounted
on a milk-white steed, was conveyed in a sort of triumph to New
Town, the timbermen performing the cavalcade on foot. The
commitment was directed to the under-sheriff in New Town, a
saddler by profession, who immediately waited on him to the
prison; he found it well peopled, and his ears were confused with
almost as many dialects as put a stop to the building of Babel.
Mr. Carew saluted them, and courteously inquired what countrymen
they were: some were from Kilkenny, some Limerick, some Dublin,
others of Somerset, Dorset, Devon, and Cornwall; so that he found
he had choice enough of companions, and, as he saw he had no
remedy but patience, he endeavoured to amuse himself as well as he
could. Looking through the bars one day, he espied a whipping-post
and gallows, at which he turned to his companions, and cried out,
A fine sight truly this is, my friends! which was a jest many of
them could not relish, as they had before tasted of the whipping;
looking on the other side, he saw a fine house, and demanding
whose it was, they told him it was the assembly-house. While he
was thus amusing himself, reflecting on the variety of his fate,
fortune was preparing a more agreeable scene for him. A person
coming up to the window, asked where the runaway was, who had been
brought in that day, Mr. Carew composedly told him he was the man;
they then entered into discourse, inquiring of each other of what
country they were, and soon found they were pretty near
neighbours, the person who addressed him being one out of
Dorsetshire. While they were talking, our hero seeing the tops of
some vessels riding in the river, inquired what place they
belonged to. The man replied, To the west of England, to one Mr.
Buck of Biddeford, to whom most of the town belonged. Our hero's
heart leaped for joy at this good news, and he hastily asked if
the captains Kenny, Hervey, Hopkins, and George Burd were there;
the man replying in the affirmative, still heightened his
satisfaction. Will you have the goodness to be an unfortunate
prisoner's friend, said he to the person he was talking with, and
present my humble duty to any of them, but particularly to Captain
Hervey, and inform them I am here. The man very civilly replied he
would do it; and asked what he should tell them was his name?
Carew, replied our hero. Away ran the messenger with great haste,
but before he got half way, forgetting the name ran back again to
ask it. Tell them my name is Carew, the rat-catcher; away went the
man again, repeating all the way, Carew, the rat-catcher, lest he
should forget it a second time; and he now executed his message so
well, that very soon after came the captains to the gaol door.

Inquiring for Carew, the rat-catcher, as they wanted to speak with
him; our hero, who heard them, answered with a tantivy, and a
halloo to the dogs; upon which Captain Hervey swore it was Carew,
and fell a-laughing very heartily, then coming to the window, they
very cordially shook hands with him, saying, they should as soon
have expected to have seen Sir Robert Walpole there as him. They
then inquired by what means he came there; and he informed them
circumstantially of everything as already mentioned. The captains
asked him if he would drink a glass of rum, which he accepted of
very gladly in his present condition; one of them quickly sent
down to the storehouse for a bottle of rum and a bottle of
October, and then they all went into the gaol, and sat down with
him. Thus did he see himself once more surrounded by his friends,
so that he scarcely regretted his meeting with the timber-men, as
they had brought him into such good company. He was so elevated
with his good fortune, that he forgot all his misfortunes, and
passed the evening as cheerfully as if he was neither a slave nor
a prisoner. The captains inquired if he had been sold to a planter
before he made his escape; he replied in the negative, when they
informed him, that unless his captain came and demanded him, he
would be publicly sold the next court-day. When they took their
leaves, they told him they would see him the next morning.

Accordingly they returned very early, and having got admittance
into the prison, hailed him with the pleasing sound of liberty,
telling him, they had agreed among themselves to purchase him,
then give him his release, and furnish him with proper passes; but
instead of receiving this joyful news with the transports they
expected, our hero stood for some time silent and lost in thought.
During this while, he reflected within himself, whether his honour
would permit him to purchase his liberty on these terms: and it
was indeed no little struggle which passed in his breast on this
occasion. On the one side, Liberty, with all her charms, presented
herself, and wooed to be accepted, supported by Fear, who set
before his eyes all the horrors and cruelties of a severe slavery;
on the other side, dame Honour, with a majestic mien, forbade him,
sounding loudly in his ears how it would read in future story,
that the ingenious Mr. Carew had no contrivance left to regain his
lost liberty, but meanly to purchase it at his friends' expense.
For some time did these passions remain in equipoise; as thou hast
often seen the scales of some honest tradesman, before he weighs
his commodity; but at length honour preponderated, and liberty and
fear flew up and kicked the beam; he therefore told the captains
he had the most grateful sense of this instance of their love, but
that he could never consent to purchase his freedom at their
expense: and therefore desired they would only do him the favour
to acquaint Captain Froade of his being there. The captains were
quite amazed at this resolution, and used great entreaties to
persuade him to alter it, but all in vain; so that at last they
were obliged to comply with his earnest request, in writing to
Captain Froade.

Captain Froade received with great pleasure the news of his being
in custody in New Town, and soon sent round his long-boat, paid
all costs and charges, and brought him once more on board his
ship. The captain received him with a great deal of malicious
satisfaction in his countenance, telling him in a taunting manner,
that, though he had promised Sir William Courtney to be at home
before him, he should find himself damnably mistaken; and then
with a tyrannic tone bade him strip, calling the boatswain to
bring up a cat-o'-nine-tails, and tie him fast up to the main
geers; accordingly our hero was obliged to undergo a cruel and
shameful punishment. Here, gentle reader, if thou hast not a heart
made of something harder than adamant, thou canst not choose but
melt at the sufferings of our hero; he, who but just before, did
what would have immortalised the name of Caesar or Alexander, is
now rewarded for it with cruel and ignominious stripes, far from
his native country, wife, children, or any friends, and still
doomed to undergo severe hardships. As soon as the captain had
satisfied his revenge, he ordered Mr. Carew on shore, taking him
to a blacksmith, whom he desired to make a heavy iron collar for
him, which in Maryland they call a pot-hook, and is usually put
about the necks of runaway slaves. When it was fastened on, the
captain jeeringly cried, "Now run away if you can; I will make you
help to load this vessel, and then I'll take care of you, and send
you to the ironworks of Susky Hadlam."

Captain Froade soon after left the vessel, and went up to a
storehouse at Tuckhoe, and the first mate to Kent island, whilst
the second mate and boatswain kept the ship; in the meantime our
hero was employed in loading the vessel, and doing all manner of
drudgery. Galled with a heavy yoke and narrowly watched, he began
to lose all hopes of escape; his spirits now began to fail him,
and he almost gave himself up to despair, little thinking his
deliverance so near at hand, as he found it soon to be.

One day, as he was employed in his usual drudgery, reflecting
within himself upon his unhappy condition, he unexpectedly saw his
good friends, Captains Hervey and Hopkins, two of the Biddeford
captains, who, as has been before related, had offered to redeem
him from the prison at New Town; he was overjoyed at the sight of
them, not that he expected any deliverance from them, but only as
they were friends he had been so much obliged to.

The captains came up and inquired very kindly how it fared with
him, and how he bore the drudgery they saw him employed in;
adding, that he had better have accepted the offer they made him
at New Town. Our hero gallantly replied, that however severe the
hardships he underwent, and were they still more so, he would
rather choose to suffer them, than purchase liberty at their cost.
The captains, charmed with his magnanimity, were resolved to make
one attempt more to get him his liberty. They soon after sounded
the boatswain and mate; and finding them not greatly averse to
give him an opportunity to escape, they took him aside, and thus
addressed him:—"Friend Carew, the offer we made you at New Town
may convince you of the regard we have for you; we therefore
cannot think of leaving the country before we have, by some means
or other, procured your liberty; we have already sounded the
boatswain and mate, and find we can bring them to wink at your
escape; but the greatest obstacle is, that there is forty pounds
penalty and half a year's imprisonment, for anyone that takes off
your iron collar, so that you must be obliged to travel with it,
till you come among the friendly Indians, many miles distant from
hence, who will assist you to take it off, for they are great
friends with the English, and trade with us for lattens, kettles,
frying-pans, gunpowder and shot; giving us in exchange buffalo and
deer skins, with other sorts of furs. But there are other sorts of
Indians, one of which are distinguished by a very flat forehead,
who use cross-bows in fighting; the other of a very small stature,
who are great enemies, and very cruel to the whites; these you
must endeavour by all means to avoid, for if you fall into their
hands, they will certainly murder you.—And here the reader will,
we make no doubt, be pleased to see some account of the Indians,
among whom our hero was treated with so much kindness and
civility, as we shall relate in its proper place.


Chapter XI.
A Digression on the History of the Colony of
Maryland

At the first settling of Maryland, there were several nations of
them governed by petty kings. Mr. Calvert, Lord Baltimore's
brother having been sent by him to make the first settlement in
Maryland, landed at Potowmac town; during the infancy of
Werowance, Archibau his uncle, who governed his territories in his
minority, received the English in a friendly manner. From Potowmac
the governor proceeded to Piscataqua, about twenty leagues higher,
where he found many Indians assembled, and among them an
Englishman, Captain Henry Fleet, who had lived there several years
in great esteem with the natives. Captain Fleet brought the
Werowance, or Prince, on board the governor's pinnace to treat
with him. Mr. Calvert asked him, whether he was agreeable that he
and his people should settle in his country. The prince replied, I
will not bid you go, neither will I bid you stay, but you may use
your own discretion. The Indians, finding their prince stay longer
on board than they expected, crowded down to the water-side to
look after him, fearing the English had killed him, and they were
not satisfied till he showed himself to them, to please them. The
natives, who fled from St. Clement's isle, when they saw the
English come as friends, returned to their habitations; and the
governor, not thinking it advisable to settle so high up the river
in the infancy of the colony, sent his pinnaces down the river,
and went with Captain Fleet to a river on the north side of the
Potowmac, within four or five leagues, in his long-boat, and came
to the town of Yoamaco, from which the Indians of that
neighbourhood are called Yoamacoes. The governor landed, and
treating with the prince there, acquainted him with the occasion
of his coming, to whom the Indian said little, but invited him to
his house, entertained him kindly, and gave him his own bed to lie
on. The next day he showed him the country, and the governor
determining to make the first settlement there, ordered all his
ships and pinnaces to come thither to him.

To make his entry the more safe and peaceable, he presented the
Werowance and Wilsos, and principal men of the place, with some
English cloth, axes, hoes and knives, which they accepted very
kindly, and freely consented that he and his company should dwell
in one part of the town, and reserving the other for themselves.
Those Indians, who inhabited that part which was assigned to the
English, readily abandoned their houses to them; and Mr. Calvert
immediately set hands to work to plant corn. The natives agreed
further to leave the whole town to the English as soon as their
harvest was in; which they did accordingly, and both English and
Indians promised to live friendly together. If any injury was done
on either part, the nation offending was to make satisfaction.
Thus, on the 27th March, 1634, the governor took possession of the
town, and named it St. Mary's.

There happened an event which much facilitated this with the
Indians. The Susquehanocks, a warlike people, dwelling between
Chesapeake Bay and Delaware Bay, were wont to make incursions on
their neighbours, partly for dominion and partly for booty, of
which the women were most desired by them. The Yoamacoes, fearing
these Susquehanocks, had a year before the English arrived,
resolved to desert their habitations, and remove higher into the
country; many of them were actually gone, and the rest prepared to 
follow them. The ships and pinnaces arriving at the town, the
Indians were amazed and terrified at the sight of them, especially
at hearing their cannon thunder, when they came to anchor.

The first thing that Mr. Calvert did was to fix a court of guard,
and erect a storehouse; and he had not been there many days before
Sir John Harvey, governor of Virginia, came there to visit him, as
did several of the Indian Werowances, and many other Indians, from
several parts of the continent; among others, came the king of
Patuxent, and, being carried aboard the ship, then at anchor in
the river, was placed between the governor of Virginia and the
governor of Maryland, at an entertainment made for him and others.
A Patuxent Indian coming aboard, and seeing his king thus seated,
started back; thinking he was surprised, he would have fain leaped
overboard, and could not be persuaded to enter the cabin, till the
Werowance came himself, and satisfied him he was in no danger.
This king had formerly been taken prisoner by the English of
Virginia. After the storehouse was finished and the ship unladen,
Mr. Calvert ordered the colours to be brought ashore, which was
done with great solemnity, the gentlemen and their servants
attending in arms: several volleys were fired on board and on
shore, as also the cannon, at which the natives were struck with
admiration, such at least as had not heard the firing of pieces of
ordnance before, to whom it could not be dreadful.

The kings of Patuxent and Yoamaco were present at this ceremony,
with many other Indians of Yoamaco; and the Werowance of Patuxent
took that occasion to advise the Indians of Yoamaco to be careful
to keep the league that had been made with the English. He stayed
in town several days, and was full of his Indian compliments; when
he went away he made this speech to the governor: "I love the
English so well, that, should they go about to kill me, if I had
so much breath as to speak, I would command my people not to
revenge my death, for I know they would not do such a thing,
except it were through my own fault."

This infant colony supplied themselves with Indian corn at
Barbadoes, which, at their first arrival, they began to use to
save their French store of flour and oatmeal. The Indian women,
perceiving that their servants did not know how to dress it, made
their bread for them, and taught them to do it themselves. There
was Indian corn enough in the country, and these new adventurers
soon after shipped off 10,000 bushels for New England, to purchase
salt fish and other provisions. While the English and Indians
lived at St. Mary's together, the natives went every day to hunt
with the newcomers for deer and turkeys, which, when they had
caught, they gave to the English, or sold for knives, beads, and
such like trifles. They also brought them good store of fish, and
behaved themselves very kindly, suffering their women and children
to come among them, which was a certain sign of their confidence
in them.

Most of the Indians still follow the religion and customs of their
ancestors; and are not become either more pious or more polite by
the company of the English.

As to their religion, they have all of them some dark notions
about God; but some of them have brighter ones, if a person may be
believed who had this confession from the mouth of an Indian:
"That they believed God was universally beneficent; that his
dwelling was in heaven above, and the influence of his goodness
reached to the earth beneath; that he was incomprehensible in his
excellence, and enjoyed all possible felicity; that his duration
was eternal, his perfection boundless, and that he possessed
everlasting happiness." So far the savage talked as rationally of
the existence of a God as a Christian divine or philosopher could
have done; but when he came to justify their worshipping of the
Devil, whom they call Okee, his notions were very heterodox. He
said, "It is true God is the giver of all good things, but they
flow naturally and promiscuously from him; that they are showered
down upon all men without distinction; that God does not trouble
himself with the impertinent affairs of men, nor is concerned at
what they do, but leaves them to make the most of their free will,
and to secure as many as they can of the good things that flow
from him; that therefore it was to no purpose either to fear or
worship him; but, on the contrary, if they did not pacify the evil
spirit, he would ruin their health, peace, and plenty, he being
always visiting them in the air, thunders, storms, &c."

As to the idol which they all worship, and is kept in a temple
called Quiocasan, he seemed to have a very different opinion of
its divinity, and cried out against the juggling of the priests.—
This man did not talk like a common savage, and therefore we may
suppose he had studied the matter more than his countrymen, who,
for the generality, paid a great deal of devotion to the idol, and
worshipped him as their chief deity.

Their priests and conjurors are highly reverenced by them. They
are given extremely to pawning or conjuring; and one of them very
lately conjured a shower of rain for a gentleman's plantation, in
a time of drought, for two bottles of rum. We are not apt to give
credit to such supernatural events; and, had we not found this in
an author who was on the spot, we should have rejected it as a
fable.

Their priests promise fine women, eternal spring, and every
pleasure in perfection in the other world, which charmed them in
this; and threaten them with lakes of fire, and torments by a
fairy in the shape of an old woman. They are often bloody in their
sacrifices, and offer up young children to the devil. They have a
superstitious ceremony among them, which they call Huskanawing,
and is performed thus: they shut up ten or twelve young men, the
most deserving among them, about twenty years of age, in a strong
inclosure, made on purpose, like a sugar loaf, and every way open
like a lattice, for the air to pass through; they are kept for
several months, and are allowed to have no sustenance but the
infusion or decoction of poisonous intoxicating roots, which turn
their brains, and they run stark mad.

By this it is pretended they lose the remembrance of all former
things, even of their parents, treasure, and language, as if they
had drunk of the water of oblivion, drawn out of the lake of
Lethe. When they have been in this condition as long as their
custom directs, they lessen this intoxicating potion; and, by
degrees, the young men recover the use of their senses; but before
they are quite well, they are shown in their towns; and the youths
who have been huskanawed are afraid to discover the least sign of
their remembering anything of their past lives; for, in such a
case, they must be huskanawed again, and they are disciplined so
severely the second time, that it generally kills them.

After the young men have passed this trial, they are Coucarouses,
or men of quality in their nations; and the Indians say they do it
to take away from youth all childish impressions, and that strong
partiality to persons and things which is contracted before reason
takes place.

The Indian priests, to command the respect of the people, make
themselves look as ugly and as terrible as they can; the conjurors
always share with them in their deceit, and they gain by it; the
Indians consult both of them before they go on any enterprise.
There are no priestesses or witches among them. They erect altars
on every remarkable occasion, and have temples built like their
common cabins, in which their idol stands, and the corpse of their
kings and rulers are preserved.

They have no sort of literature among them; and their way of
communicating things from one to another is by hieroglyphics. They
make their accounts by units, tens, hundreds, &c., as the English
do; but they reckon their years by cohonks, or winters, and divide
every year into five seasons; the budding time, the earing of the
corn, the summer, the harvest, and the winter.

Their months they count by moons. They divide the day into three
parts, the rise, power, and lowering, of the sun; and keep their 
accounts by knots on a string, or notches on a stick, of which
Captain Smith relates a very pleasant story; that, when the
princess Pocahonta went for England, a Coucarouse, or lord of her
own nation, attended her; his name was Uttamaccomack: and king
Powhatan, Pocahonta's father, commanded him, when he arrived in
England, to count the people, and give him an account of their
number. Uttamaccomock, when he came ashore, got a stick, intending
to count them by notches; but he soon found that his arithmetic
would be to no purpose, and threw away his stick. At his return,
the king asked him how many people there were? And he replied,
count the stars of the sky, the leaves upon the trees, and the
sand upon the seashore, and you will know how many are the people
in England.

They esteem the marriage-vow as the most sacred of all
engagements, and abhor divorces; adultery is the most unpardonable
of all crimes amongst them, and seldom occurs without exemplary
punishment.

Their maidens are very chaste; and if anyone of them happen to
have a child before marriage, her fortune is spoiled. They are
very sprightly and good humoured, and the women generally
handsome. Their manner of handling infants is very rough: as soon
as the child is born, they plunge it over head and ears in cold
water, and they bind it naked to a board, making a hole in the
proper place for evacuation. Between the child and the board they
put some cotton, wool, or fur, and let it lie in this posture till
the bones begin to harden, the joints to knit, and the limbs to
grow strong; they then loosen it from the board, and let it crawl
about where it pleases. From this custom, it is said, the Indians
derive the neatness and exactness of their limbs, which are the
most perfect in the world. Some of them are of a gigantic stature,
live to a great age, and are stronger than others; but there is
not a crooked, bandy-legged, or ill-shaped, Indian to be seen.
Some nations of them are very tall and large limbed, but others
are short and small; their complexion is a dark brown and tawny.
They paint themselves with a pecone root, which stains them a
reddish colour. They are clear when they are young, but greasing
and sunning make their skin turn hard and black. Their hair, for
the most part, is coal black; so are their eyes; they wear their
hair cut after several whimsical modes, the persons of note always
keep a long lock behind; the women wearing it very long, hanging
at their backs, or twisted up with beads; and all the better sort
adorn their heads with a kind of coronet. The men have no beards,
and, to prevent their having any, use certain devices, which they
will not communicate to the English.

Their clothes are a mantle girt close in the middle, and
underneath a piece of cloth tied round their waist, and reaching
down to the middle of the thigh. The common sort only tie a piece
of cloth or skin round the middle. As for their food they boil,
broil, or roast, all the meat they eat; honomy is the standing
dish, and consists of Indian corn soaked, broken in a mortar, and
then boiled in water over a gentle fire ten or twelve hours
together. They draw and pluck their fowls, skin and paunch their
quadrupeds, but dress their fish with the scales on, and without
gutting; they leave the scales, entrails, and bones, till they eat
the fish, when they throw the offal away. Their food is chiefly
beeves, turtle, several species of snakes, broth made of deer's
humbles, peas, beans, &c. They have no set meals: they eat when
they are hungry, and drink nothing but water. Their bread is made
of Indian corn, wild oats, or the seed of the sun-flower; they eat
it alone, and not with meat.

They travel always on foot with a gun or bow. They live upon the
game they kill, and lie under a tree upon a little high grass. The
English prohibit them to keep corn, sheep, or hogs, lest they
should steal their neighbour's.

When they come to rivers, they presently patch up a canoe of birch
bark, cross over in it, and leave it on the river's bank, if they
think they shall not want it; otherwise they carry it along with
them.

Their way of receiving strangers is by the pipe, or calumet of
peace. Of this Pere Henepin has given a long account in his
voyage, and the pipe is as follows: they fill a pipe of tobacco,
larger and bigger than any common pipe, light it, and then the
chief of them takes a whiff, gives it to the stranger, and if he
smoke of it, it is peace; if not, war; if peace, the pipe is
handed all round the company.

The diseases of the Indians are very few, and easy to be cured:
they for the most part arise from excessive heats and colds, which
they get rid of by sweating. As for aches, and settled pains in
the joints or limbs, they use caustics and scarifying. The priests
are their physicians, and from their childhood are taught the
nature and use of simples, in which their knowledge is excellent;
but they will not communicate it, pretending it is a gift of God;
and by this mystery they make it the more valuable.

Their riches consist of furs, peak, roenocke, and pearl. Their
peak and roenocke are made of shells; the peak is an English
bugle, but the roenocke is a piece of cockle, drilled through like
a bead. Before the English came among them, the peak and the
roenocke were all their treasure; but now they set a value on
their fur and pearl, and are greedy of keeping quantities of them
together. The pearl is good, and formerly was not so rare as it is
at this time.

They had no iron tools till the English brought them over: their
knives were sharpened reeds or shells, their axes sharp stones.
They rubbed fire, by turning the end of a hard piece of wood upon
the side of one that is soft and dry, which at last would burn.
They felled great trees by burning them down at the root, having
ways of keeping the fire from ascending. They hollowed them with a
gentle fire, and scraped the trunk clean, and this made their
canoes, of which some were thirty feet long. They are very good
handicraft men, and what they do is generally neat and convenient.

Their kingdoms descended to the next heir, male or female, and
they were exact in preserving the succession in the right line.
If, as it often happened, one great prince subjected the other,
those conquests commonly were lost at his death, and the nation
returned again to the obedience of their natural princes. They
have no written laws, neither can they have any, having no
letters.

Their lands are in common, and their Werowances, or judges, are
all lord-chancellors, deciding causes and inflicting punishments
according as they think fit. These Werowances and the Coucarouses
are their terms to distinguish the men of quality; the former are
their war-captains, and the latter such as have passed the trial
of huskanawing. Their priests and conjurors have great authority
among them. They have servants whom they call black boys, and are
very exact in requiring the respect that is due to their several
qualities.

Most of the Indians live on the eastern shore, where they have two
or three little towns; some of them go over to the other side, in
winter time, to hunt for deer, being generally employed by the
English. They take delight in nothing else, and it is very rare
that any of them will embrace the Christian way of living and
worship. There are about 500 fighting Indians in all the province;
the cause of their diminution proceeded not from wars with the
English, for they have none with them worth speaking of, but from
the perpetual discords and wars among themselves. The female sex
have always swept away a great many.

One thing is observed in them, though they are a people very
timorous and cowardly in fight, yet when taken prisoners and
condemned, they will die like heroes, braving the most exquisite
tortures that can be invented, and singing all the time they are
upon the rack.

We find several of the Indians doing actions which would do honour
to the greatest heroes of antiquity: thus captain Smith, who was
one of the first adventurers in planting the colony of Virginia,
being taken prisoner, while he was making discoveries, by king
Oppecamcanough, he not only spared Mr. Smith's life, but carried
him to his town and feasted him; and afterwards presented him to
Powhaton, the chief king of the savages, who would have beheaded
him, had he not been saved by the intercession and generosity of
his daughter, Pocahonta, who, when Mr. Smith's head was on the
block, and she could not prevail with her father to give him his
life, put her own head upon his, and ventured receiving the blow
to save him, though she was scarce then sixteen years of age.

Some time after, Sir Thomas Dale sent captain Argall to Patowmac
to buy corn, where he met with Pocahonta. He invited her to come
aboard his ship, which with some difficulty she consented to,
being betrayed by the king of Postcany, brother to the king of
Patowmac, with whom she then resided.

Argall, having got her into his custody, detained her, and carried
her to James's Town, intending to oblige her father, king
Powhaton, to come to what terms he pleased for the deliverance of
his daughter. Though the king loved her tenderly, yet he would not
do anything for her sake which he thought was not for his own and
the nation's interest; nor would he be prevailed upon to conclude
a firm treaty of peace till he heard his daughter, who had turned
a Christian, was christened Rebecca, and married to Mr. John
Rolfe, an English gentleman, her uncle giving her away in the
church.

Powhaton approved of the marriage, took it for a sincere token of
friendship, and was so pleased with it, that he concluded a league
with the English in the year 1613.

Some time after, Sir Thomas Dale going for England, took Mr. Rolfe
and his wife Pocahonta with him, and arrived at Plymouth.

Captain Smith, hearing the lady who had been so kind to him was
arrived in England, and being engaged at that time in a voyage to
New England, which hindered his waiting on her himself, petitioned
queen Anne, consort to king James, on her behalf, setting forth
the civilities he had received from her, and obligations she had
laid upon the English, by the service she had done them with her
father.

The queen received this petition very graciously; and before
Captain Smith embarked for New England, Mr. Rolfe came with his
wife from Plymouth to London. The smoke of the city offending her,
he took lodgings for her at Brentford, and thither Captain Smith
went with several friends to wait on her.

Pocahonta was told all along that Captain Smith was dead, to
excuse his not coming to Virginia again; from which he had been
diverted by settling a colony in New England. Wherefore, when this
lady saw him, thinking the English had injured her in telling her
a falsity, which she had ill deserved from them, she was so angry
that she would not deign to speak to him: but at last, with much
persuasion and attendance, was reconciled, and talked freely to
him: she then put him in mind of the obligations she had laid upon
him, and reproached him for forgetting her, with an air so lively,
and words so sensible, that one might have seen nature abhors
nothing more than ingratitude—a vice that even the very savages
detest.

She was carried to court by the Lady Delaware, and entertained by
ladies of the first quality, towards whom she behaved herself with
so much grace and majesty, that she confirmed the bright character
Captain Smith had given of her. The whole court was charmed with
the decency and grandeur of her deportment so much, that the poor
gentleman, her husband, was threatened to be called to an account
for marrying a princess royal without the king's consent; though
in that king James showed a very notable piece of kingcraft, for
there was no likelihood that Mr. Rolfe, by marrying Pocahonta,
could any way endanger the peace of his dominions; or that his
alliance with the king of Wicomaco could concern the king of
Great-Britain; indeed, we are told, that upon a fair and full
representation of the matter, the king was pleased to be
satisfied.

The lady Pocahonta, having been entertained with all manner of
respect in England, was taken ill at Gravesend, where she lay in
order to embark for Virginia; she died there with all the signs of
a sincere Christian and true penitent.

She had one son by Mr. Rolfe, whose posterity are at this day in
good repute in Virginia, and inherit lands by descent from her.

The language of the Indians is lofty, but narrow; the accent and
emphasis of some of their words are great and sweet, as
Okorocston, Rancoce, Oriston, Shakameton, Poquiffin, all names of
places, and as sonorous as any in Attica; then for sweetness they
have their anna, mother, issimus, brother, nelapsin and usque
oret, very good, pone, bread, morridge walk, a burying-place,
scaw, a woman, salop, a man, pappoes, a child.


Chapter XII
He Escapes Again and is Taken in by the Indians

The captains acquainted Mr. Carew, that the unfriendly Indians
were not the only enemies he had to fear, for he must expect to
encounter with great dangers and difficulties, as rattle-snakes,
horn-snakes, black-snakes, lions, leopards, bears, wolves, and
wild cats. However this did not dishearten our hero, for he was
resolved to attempt regaining his liberty, let the consequence be
what it would. The captains then gave him a pocket-compass to
steer by, a steel and tinder-box, a bag of cakes, a cheese, and
some rum, telling him, he must leave the three-notched road a
little way off, and steer to his left hand; (in Maryland they
distinguish the roads by letters or notches cut on the trees;)
that he must travel by night, and lie concealed in the day, for
forty miles, and then he would come to a part of the country quite
uninhabited; from thence he would enter the Indian country. They
likewise told him, that all the wild beasts were afraid of fire,
so that his best defence would be to strike a light and kindle
some sticks whenever he was apprehensive of being attacked by any
of them.

Our hero having received these and some other necessary
instructions, and having returned his generous benefactors many
thanks for their kindness, bidding them farewell with tears, set
out on his dangerous journey about three o'clock in the afternoon.
He had not travelled far, before he began to reflect on his
melancholy condition, alone, unarmed, unacquainted with the way,
galled with the heavy yoke, exposed every moment to the most
imminent dangers, and dark tempestuous night approaching with all
its horrors, increased its terrors; his ears were now assailed
with the dismal yells and crying of wild beasts of different
sorts, but, remembering the instructions he had received from the
captains, he soon struck fire, and kindled some sticks, and was
obliged the whole night to swing a fireband round his head; the
sight of which kept the wild beasts from coming near, for, though
they often came and looked at him, yet they soon turned tail
again, seeing the fire.

However it was with great joy he saw day-light appear, at first
dawn of which he was quite freed from those troublesome guests; he
had nothing to do but to seek the thickest tree he could find,
and, climbing up into it, he took some refreshment of sleep, which
he had great need of, having travelled hard all night. He
afterwards eat sparingly of his cheese and biscuit, fearing they
might not last till he could get a fresh supply, and then took a
very large dram of rum, with which, finding his spirits much
refreshed, and night coming on, he began his journey again,
travelling in the same manner as the preceding night, with a
firebrand whirling round his head. In this manner travelling by
night, and concealing himself by day, he went on four days, when
he reached the Blue Mountains, where he thought himself out of all
danger of pursuit, or being stopped for want of a pass. He now
travelled by day, meeting with great multitudes of buffaloes,
black bears, deer, wolves, and wild turkeys, the latter being so
large as to weigh thirty or forty pounds; none of these creatures
offered to attack him; but walking one day on the side of a small
rivulet, almost lost in thought, he was suddenly alarmed by
something he heard plunging into the water, and turning his head
to the side from whence the noise came, he was struck with the
sight of a great white bear, which, being likewise disturbed,
raised itself immediately and made towards him. Our hero now
thought there was no way to escape; however, with great presence
of mind, he stepped aside to a furze bush, and, striking a light
with all the haste he could, set it on fire; at the sight of which
the bear, who was now within a very small distance of him, turned
about, and went away roaring hideously.

Some time after this he was comically alarmed by an inoffensive
animal; as he was walking along a deer-track, he chanced to spy a
very fine tortoise-shell box, as he imagined, though he could not
conceive how it could be dropped there; and, thinking he might
make good advantage of it among the Indians, claps it into his
pocket; he had not gone far before he heard a hissing noise, which
seemed to be very near; he immediately thought it to be some
venomous snake, and endeavoured to avoid it by going out of the
path he was in; but still the noise seemed to pursue him; at last
looking down, he sees a little ugly black head peeping out of his
pocket, which he found came out of what he had picked up for a
box: he with much ado slips his fingers into his pocket, takes out
his supposed box, and flings it to the ground, when the creature,
opening the upper from the under shell, marched away; this was, as
he afterwards found, no other than a land-tortoise.

He found his journey very often obstructed by rivers and rivulets,
which he was obliged either to wade through or swim over. At
length, after many days' tiresome travel, being grievously galled
by his yoke, or collar, he discovered several tracks of the
Indians. Never did more different passions agitate the breast of
any man than did the breast of our hero at this time; on the one
side he was overjoyed at the sight of the track of any human
creature, thinking he should now get rid of his heavy collar, as
well as get some refreshment of provisions, his own having been
exhausted for almost two days past; but he had not pleased himself
long with this reflection before the idea of the barbarous and
unfriendly Indians struck into his mind, for he was quite
uncertain whether the footsteps he discovered might lead him to
the good and friendly Indians, or to those barbarous and inhuman
wretches; he now represented himself as set upon by these, against
whom he had no arms to defend himself, cruelly tormented, and at
last slain as a victim in some of their bloody sacrifices.

It was about the evening when he discovered these footsteps, and
he passed the whole night in this tormenting suspense. Very early
in the morning he discovered five Indians at a distance; his fears
represented them in the most frightful colours; they seemed of a
gigantic stature, that he thought he could perceive their faces to
be very flat and broad, which was the characteristic or mark of
the unfriendly Indians. This struck him with unusual dread, and he
now gave himself over for lost, when he saw they had espied him,
and were making towards him: they coming nearer, he perceived them
to be clothed in deer skins, their hair to be exceeding long,
hanging down a great way over their shoulders; and, to his
inexpressible joy, he distinguished they had guns in their hands,
which was a sure sign they were the friendly Indians. This raised
his spirits, and he approached them in a suppliant manner, making
signs that he craved their assistance. The Indians accosted him
with clapping their hands on their heads, and crying hush me a
top, which in their language signifies good-morrow; then taking
hold of his collar, they repeated one to another, in broken
English, a runaway! a runaway! Presently after came up two more
Indians, one of whom was a person of fine majestic appearance,
whose dress was by far more magnificent than any of the others.
His habit being a most beautiful panther's skin faced with fur:
his hair was adorned with a great variety of fine feathers, and
his face painted with a great many colours. By these marks of
distinction, Mr. Carew supposed him to be their king or prince,
and indeed such he was; he spoke very good English, and accosted
him as the others had done before. He then brought him to the
wigwam, which is a name they give their houses, which are no more
than stakes driven into the ground, covered over with deer or
other skins. Here, observing that our hero was grievously hurt by
his collar, this good king immediately set himself about freeing
him from it; but, as he had no proper tool for that purpose, he
was at a great loss how to execute it; but at last, taking the
steel of Mr. Carew's tinder-box, he jagged it into a kind of saw,
with which he cut off his collar, but not without much labour, his
majesty sweating heartily at the work. He then carried him into
his own wigwam, which appeared very handsomely furnished. Here he
ordered some Indian bread, and other refreshments, to be set
before Mr. Carew, who ate very heartily. During this the prince
acquainted him his name was George Lillycraft; that his father was
one of those kings who were in England in the reign of Queen Anne;
and then showed him some fine laced clothes, which were made a
present of to him by the late king George of England (meaning his
late majesty king George the First); he expressed a great
affection for his brother kings of England, as he called them, and
for the English nation in general. Soon after came in the queen,
dressed in a short jacket, leading in her hand a young prince, who
both repeated the word runaway twice.

Next day the king presented him to the wisos, or chief men of the
town, who received him with a great deal of civility, and tokens
of high esteem. He ate every day at the king's table, and had a
lodging assigned to him in his wigwam, and grew every day more and
more in esteem among them, being consulted in all matters of
difficulty. Thus sudden are the scenes of life shifted and
changed; for a brave man will never despair under whatsoever
misfortunes; for our hero, who but a few weeks before was treated
like a beast of burden, heavily loaded, cruelly whipped, coarsely
fed, and all by the insolence and inhumanity of his own
countrymen, is now seated, in a strange country, with kings and
princes, and consulted by a whole nation.

King Lillycraft, who was a man of very good natural sense, used to
discourse with, and ask Mr. Carew many questions of the customs
and manners of his brother kings in England. Being told one day
that the king of England never stirred abroad without being
surrounded with a great number of armed men, whom he paid for
defending him, and fighting for him, he very simply asked whom he
was afraid of? or whether he was constantly at war with any
neighbouring king, who might fall upon him unawares? Being told to
the contrary, he expressed very great surprise, and could not
conceive of what use these armed men were, when the king had no
enemy, adding, when I am at war, my people are my guard, and fight
for me without being paid for it, and would each of them lay down
his life to defend mine; and when I am at peace, I can fear no
evil from my own people, therefore I have no need of armed men
about me. Being told another time that the king of England kept
himself generally in his wigwam, or palace, surrounded by certain
officers, who permitted no one to come near him but by their
permission, which was the greatest difficulty in the world to
obtain, and that not a thousandth part of the people, who lived in
the town where the palace was, had ever seen him in their lives,
he turned away from Mr. Carew in a passion, telling him, He was
certain he deceived him, and belied his good brother of England:
for how, added he, can he be the king of a people whom he hath no
knowledge of? or how can he be beloved by his subjects who have
never seen him? how can he redress their grievances, or provide
for their wants? how can he lead his people against their enemies?
or how know what his subjects stand in need of, in the distant
parts of the kingdom, if he so seldom stirs out of his wigwam?
Being told that the king of England was informed of, and
transacted all this by means of the officers that were about him,
he replied, It might be so; but if he should ever chance to go to
England, he should talk with his good friend the king upon these
matters, as he could not clearly apprehend how they could be. For
my part, added he, I know and am known by all my subjects. I
appear daily among them, hear their complaints, redress their
grievances, and am acquainted with every place in my kingdom.
Being told the people of England paid their king, yearly, vast
sums out of the profits of their labour, he laughed, and cried, O
poor king! adding, I have often given to my subjects, but never
received anything from them. [Note: The Indian kings are obliged
to provide for the subsistence of their people]

Hunting being the principal employment and diversion of the
Indians, at which they are very expert, Mr. Carew had an
opportunity of gratifying, to the utmost, his taste for this
diversion, there scarcely passing a day but he was a party amongst
them at some hunting match or other, and most generally with the
king himself. He was now grown into such great respect among them,
that they offered him a wife out of the principal families of the
place, nearly related to the king; but our hero, notwithstanding
these honours, could not forget his native country, the love of
which glowed within his breast; he had therefore, for some time,
formed the design of leaving them, and, very soon after, found an
opportunity of doing so.

One day, being out a hunting, they chanced to fall in company with
some other Indians, near the river Delaware. When the chase was
over, they sat down to be merry together, and having got some rum
amongst them, they drank pretty freely, and fell to singing and
dancing after their country fashion.

Mr. Carew took this opportunity of slipping away, and, going down
to the river side, seized one of the canoes. Though he was
entirely unacquainted with the method of managing them, he boldly
pushed from shore, landing near Newcastle in Pennsylvania; the
place he crossed over being called Duck's Creek, which
communicates with the great Delaware. Mr. Carew being now got, as
it were, among his countrymen again, soon transformed himself into
a Quaker. [Note: Most of the inhabitants of Pennsylvania are
Quakers]. Pulling off the button from his hat, and flapping it on
every side, he put on as demure and precise a look, as if his
whole family had been Quakers, and he had never seen any other
sort of people. Here, reader, it will be necessary to remark,
that, as our hero is no longer amongst simple honest Indians,
neither polite, lettered, nor deceitful, but among polished
people, whose knowledge has taught them to forget the ways of
nature, and to act everything in disguise; whose hearts and
tongues are as far distant asunder, as the North from the South
pole, and who daily over-reach one another in the most common
occurrences of life; we hope it will be no disgrace to our hero if
among such he appears polished as the best, and puts on a fresh
disguise as often as it suits his convenience.


Chapter XIII
In Pennsylvania He Makes a Fine Quaker

The first house he went to was a barber's, of whose assistance he
had indeed need enough, not having shaved his beard since he left
the ship: here he told a moving story, saying his name was John
Elworth, of Bristol; that he had been artfully kidnapped by one
Samuel Ball, of the same place, and gone through great hardships
in making his escape. The good barber moved by his tale, willingly
lent his assistance to take off his beard; during the operation,
he entered into a good deal of chat, telling him his father was of
Exeter; and, when he went away, gave him a half-crown bill, [Note:
In Pennsylvania, and other parts of America, they make great use
of paper money] and he recommended him to Mr. Wiggil, a Quaker of
the same place. Here he told his moving story again, and got a
ten-shilling bill from Mr. Wiggil, with recommendations to the
rest of the Quakers of the place, among whom he got a great deal
of money. When he took his leave, he was recommended by them to
the Quakers of a town called Castile. Here he found a great deal
of favour, and made the best of his way to Brandywine-Ferry, in
which is room enough to lay up the whole royal navy of England;
and from thence to Chester, so called, because the people who
first settled there came for the most part from Cheshire. It
contains above a hundred houses, and a very good road for
shipping, the Delaware, on which it stands, being about three
miles over. Here are a court-house and a prison. This place is
also called Upland, and has a church dedicated to St. Paul, with a
numerous congregation of those whom, exclusive of all other
Christians, we call orthodox. Mr. Carew came here on Sunday,
stayed all the night, and the next morning he enquired out one
Mrs. Turner, a Quaker, who formerly lived at Embercomb, by
Minehead, in Somersetshire; from her he got a bill, and a
recommendation to some Quakers at Derby, about five miles further,
where she told him he would find Mr. Whitfield. On hearing this,
he set out for Derby; but, before he reached there, was overtaken
by hundreds of people going to hear Mr. Whitfield preach. Friend,
says he to one of them, where are you going so fast? Hast thou not
heard, friend, says the other, the second Christ is come? He then
joined them, and they all proceeded to Derby, where he found Mr.
Whitfield preaching in an orchard, but could not get near enough
to hear his discourse, by reason of the great concourse of people;
however, he seemed to be affected with it, and strictly imitated
the Quakers in all their sighs, groans, lifting up of the eyes,
&c. Leaving them, he went to the sign of the ship, and enquiring
where Mr. Whitfield lodged that night, was told at the justice's,
who was a miller; he then asked if he could have a bed there that
night, and being told that he might, he passed the evening very
cheerfully.

In the morning he asked for pen, ink, and paper, soon drew up a
moving petition in the name of John Moore, the son of a clergyman,
who had been taken on board the Tiger, Captain Matthews, and
carried into the Havana, from whence he had got his redemption by
means of the governor of Annapolis; that he was in the most
deplorable circumstances, having nothing to help himself with, and
hoped he would commiserate his condition. Having finished his
petition, away he went to the miller's house, where Mr. Whitfield
lodged, and found a hundred people waiting at the door to speak to
that gentleman. Looking narrowly around, he espied a young lad,
whom he found belonged to Mr. Whitfield, and going up to him very
civilly, he begged he would do an unfortunate man the kindness to
present that paper (giving him his petition) to Mr. Whitfield: and
as soon as they perceived him, the Quakers pressed round him, one
crying, Pray thee, friend, come and pray by my dear wife; and
another, Pray thee, friend, come and see my dear brother. Mr.
Whitfield made his way through them all, as well as he could,
towards Mr. Carew, whom the young lad pointed out to him. When he
came up to him, he kindly said that he was heartily sorry for his
misfortunes, but that we were all liable to them, that they
happened by the will of God, and therefore it was our duty to
submit to them with patience and resignation; then, pulling out
his pocket-book, he gave him three or four pounds of that county
paper-money. Mr. Carew returned him thanks with all the marks of
the most lively gratitude, and Mr. Whitfield wishing him well to
England, went away singing psalms with those that were about him;
and we make no doubt but Mr. Carew joined with them in the melody
of the heart for the good success he had had with Mr. Whitfield.

From hence Bampfylde was only seven miles to the city of
Philadelphia, which is one of the finest in all America, and one
of the best laid out cities in the world. It is the capital of
Pennsylvania, and, were it full of houses and inhabitants,
according to the proprietor's plan, it would be a capital fit for
a great empire; yet it is a large city, considering its late
foundation, most commodiously situated between two navigable
rivers, the Delaware and Schuylkill. He designed the town in form
of an oblong square, extending two miles in length from one river
to the other. The long streets, eight in number, and two miles in
length, he cut in right angles by others of one mile in length,
and sixteen in number, all straight and spacious. He left proper
spaces for markets, parades, quays, meeting-houses, schools,
hospitals, and other public buildings. There are a great number of
houses, and it increases every day in buildings, which are all
carried on regularly, according to the first plan. The city has
two fronts on the water, one on the east side facing to
Schuylkill, and the other on the west, facing the Delaware, which
is near two miles broad, and navigable three hundred miles, at
least for small vessels. The eastern part is the most populous, on
account of the Schuylkill, which is navigable eight hundred miles
above the falls. We have observed, that each front of the street
was to be two miles from river to river, as it was at first laid
out; but one cannot suppose that it is finished in that manner.
The streets that run against the Schuylkill are three quarters of
a mile in length; the houses are stately, the wharfs and
warehouses numerous and convenient. This city flourished so much
at first, that there were near a hundred houses, great and small
in it, in less than a year's time; and it has made answerable
progress since that period; the number of houses, at this time,
being about two thousand, and, generally speaking, better edifices
than in the cities of England, a few excepted, and those only in a
few streets. All the houses have large orchards and gardens
belonging to them; the land on which the city stands is high and
firm, and the convenience of covered docks and springs have very
much contributed to the commerce of this place, where many rich
merchants now reside, some of whom are so wealthy that they keep
their coaches. Ships may ride in six or seven fathoms water, with
a very good anchorage; the land about it is a dry wholesome level.
All owners of one thousand acres and upwards have their houses in
the two fronts, facing the rivers, and in the High-street, running
from the middle of one front to the middle of the other. Every
owner of one thousand acres has about an acre in front, and the
smaller purchasers about half an acre in the back streets, by
which means the least has room enough for a house-garden and small
orchard. High-street is a hundred feet broad, so is Broad-street,
which is in the middle of the city, running from north to south.
In the centre is a square of ten acres, for the state-house,
market-house, and school-house, as before hinted. The names of the
streets here denote the several sorts of timber that are common in
Pennsylvania, as Mulberry-street, Sassafras-street, Chesnut-
street, Walnut-street, Beech-street, Ash-street, Vine-street,
Cedar-street. There are also King-street, Broad-street, High-
street. Their court-house is built of brick, and under it is a
prison: several houses on the quay are worth four or five thousand
pounds; and thirteen ships have been on the stocks at a time: some
hundreds have been built there. The cellars and warehouses, on the
quay, are made over the river three stories high. Here are two
fairs in a year, and two markets in a week. It sends two members
to the assembly.

The inhabitants were at first mostly Quakers, and so they
continue. It was some time before there was a church built after
the manner of England; but as soon as one was built, it was called
Christ-church. It had, in a few years, a very numerous
congregation, and King William ordered an allowance of fifty-three
pounds a-year to the minister; which, with voluntary
contributions, made a very handsome provision for him. There are
about twelve hundred of the inhabitants that are of this
congregation, who have for some years had the benefit of the
organ; and though it looked and sounded strange to the Quakers at
first, yet they are now so far reconciled to it, as to bear with
their neighbours having it without grumbling. There are, besides
this, several meeting-houses; viz. for the Quakers, who are
properly the church as by law established, being the originals;
the Presbyterians, the Baptists, and a Spanish church.

According to the plan, there is in each quarter of the city a
square of eight acres, intended for the same uses as were
Moorfields in London—walks and exercises for the citizens. The
great dock is formed by an inlet of the river Delaware, at the
south corner of the front of the wharfs, and has a bridge over it
at the entrance: several creeks run into the city out of the two
rivers; and there is no city in Holland that is so naturally
accommodated with fine and commodious canals, as this might very
easily be. The quay is beautiful, about two hundred feet square,
to which a ship of five hundred tons may lay her broadside; and,
as these surprising advantages have already rendered it one of the
best trading towns in the British empire out of Europe, so in all
probability it will continue to increase in commerce, riches, and
buildings, till for number and magnificence it will have no equal
in America; where the French have not, nor are likely to have,
anything like it. Here are almost all sorts of trades and
mechanics, as well as merchants and planters. Here the assemblies
and courts of judicature are held, and the business of the
province is chiefly managed, as in all capitals. Here are
printing-houses, and several newspapers published. In a word, here
are all things necessary for an Englishman's profit and pleasure.

Mr. Carew, walking through the High-street, had a mind to refresh
himself with a nip of punch; the first public house he chanced to
come to was kept by an Irishman, and asking him if he sold punch,
Yes, my dear honey, replied the man. Arrah, says Mr. Carew, are
you my countryman, dear joy? quite in the Irish brogue. Yes,
replied the man: What, do you belong to one of our vessels?—No,
but I belong to Captain Dubois, of Dublin, who was taken off the
Capes, and carried into the Havana.—Arrah, dear joy, I know
Captain Dubois very well, replied the Irishman, come in.
Accordingly in went Mr. Carew: the Irishman was so well pleased
with his countryman, (for, giving a very particular account of
many places in Ireland, and counterfeiting the brogue extremely
well, he did not suspect him to be any other,) that he entertained
him kindly, and they passed the day merrily together.

The next morning his host takes him out to see the city: Mr. Carew
did not content himself with idly gazing, as most of our modern
travellers do; but diligently inquired the names of the principal
merchants and places, and informed himself of all those
circumstances, which could be of any service to him. At length,
seeing a very fine house, he inquired whose it was; and being told
Proprietor Penn's, who was just come from England with his
brother-in-law, Captain Frame, he takes leave of his host, telling
him he had a little business to transact, and would be at home
presently, for he should be able to find his way back without his
staying for him.—Having thus got rid of the Irishman, he claps his
right hand into his coat, as if he had lost the use of it; and
then, going up to the proprietor's, knocks at the door, which was
opened to him by a negro, with a silver collar round his neck: he
inquired if the proprietor lived there, and if he was at home:
being told he was, Pray tell him, says he, that a poor man desires
the favour of speaking with him. The negro then bid him come into
the court: soon after, out came the proprietor, very plainly
dressed, and his brother, Captain Frame, in his regimentals. The
proprietor came up to him, inquiring who he was, and what he
wanted with him: he replied he was a poor unfortunate man, who
craved his honour's charitable assistance: that his name was John
Dawkins, of the city of Exeter; and that he belonged to Captain
Davis's ship of that place, who was taken near the Capes. Captain
Frame, seeing him a lusty tall fellow, presently cries out,
revenge! revenge! my brave boy! you shall go along with me, and
fight the dogs! Mr. Carew replied with a sigh, that he should be
glad to do that, but that, it was his misfortune, by the
severities and hardships in prison, to have lost the use of his
right arm by the dead palsy. This moved their compassion so much,
that each of them gave him a guinea; the proprietor telling him he
would take care to send him home with Captain Read, who would
sail, very soon; then asking him if he had been at the governor's,
and he replying in the negative, the proprietor told him he should
go there, for he was a very good-natured man, and would assist
him; then calling to the black, he bid him show the poor man to
the governor's. As they were going along, he informed himself of
the black what countryman the governor was; and being told a
Welshman, and his name Thomas, he took care to make his advantage
of it. When he came to the governor's and inquired for him, he was
told he was walking in the garden; while he was waiting for his
coming out, in came the proprietor and his brother; and, going
into the garden, they represented his case to the governor, who,
coming in, inquired where he was born, &c.; he told him, as he had
before done the proprietor, and added, that he had married Betty
Larkey, parson Griffy's maid, of Wales, and that the parson had a
son at Bishop's Nympton, in Devon: the governor replied he knew
the parson very well, and likewise Betty Larkey; and after he had
asked him some questions about them, which Mr. Carew answered very
readily, he gave him two guineas.

In this manner did he apply to the most of the principal merchants
of Philadelphia, always suiting some circumstances of his story in
particular to the person he applied to; which he did, by
diligently inquiring what places they came from in England, who
were their friends and acquaintance, and the like, which he knew
how to suit most to his purpose.


Chapter XIV
His Further Adventures in America

Captain Read being now ready to sail, and Mr. Carew having a
curiosity of seeing more of the country, he thought proper to
leave Philadelphia without taking leave of any of his good friends
there. From this place he went into Buckingham county, where he
inquired for one George Boon, a justice of the peace in that
county, who formerly lived at Bradnich, in Devon, his father being
a weaver there. Here he went by his own name, telling him, he had
been taken prisoner, and carried into the Havana, where he had
lain many months. The justice having known his father very well,
entertained him generously, showed him the country, and gave him
three guineas at his departure, to help to pay his passage.

From thence he went to Burlington, the first town in West New-
Jersey, which contains about two hundred and fifty families, and
has an answerable number of acres laid out for plantations. The
houses are well built, and almost all of brick. The market affords
plenty of all sorts of provisions, which are as good here as
anywhere in America.

From thence to Perth Amboy, so called in honour of the Duke of
Perth. It is at the mouth of the Rantan, which runs into Sandyhook
bay, and is able to contain five hundred ships. The plan of this
city was laid out very regularly and spaciously. The plot of
ground was divided into one hundred and fifty shares, for
purchasers to build upon. Four acres are preserved for a market-
place, and three for public wharfage—very useful things, if there
had been inhabitants, trade, and shipping. The town being thus
skilfully and commodiously laid out, some Scots began building,
especially a house for the governor, which was then as little
wanted as a wharf or a market. The whole plan of the city consists
of one thousand and seventy-nine acres, and there are two good
roads from it to Piscataqua and Woodbridge. Ships in one tide can
come up to the port, and be at the merchants' doors, though of
three hundred tons burden; but the Perth city has not above two or
three hundred men, women, and children.

From thence over a ferry, into a town called Trent-town, in
Staten-island; and from thence over Brunswick ferry to East
Jersey, where he found out a Mr. Matthews, a miller, who formerly
lived at Whitechurch, near Lime, in Dorset; and, making use of his
old story of having been taken, he was received by Mr. Matthews
with great hospitality; he kept him three days in his house, and
would have entertained him still longer. At his departure he gave
him a guinea, with several letters of recommendation, and remitted
letters by him to his friends in England, sending his servant with
him as far as Elizabeth town, which is three miles within a creek
opposite to the west end of Staten-island. Here the first English
settlement was made, and if any place in the Jerseys may be said
to have thriven, it is this; for, notwithstanding the endeavours
of the proprietors to make a capital of Perth, by calling it a
city, Elizabeth town has near six times the number of inhabitants,
containing above two hundred and fifty families, and forty
thousand acres of land laid out. Here the proprietors have a
plantation, which goes by the name of their farm. The government
of the province is here managed, courts are kept, assemblies held,
and the greatest part of the trade of the colony carried on. Here
he met with one Mr. Nicholas, a Cornish man, who gave him a ten-
shilling bill, and recommended him to one Mr. Anderson, in Long-
island, sometimes called Nassau-island, stretching from Fairfield
county, in a fine spot of ground, one hundred and fifty miles in
length, and twenty in breadth. Here he changed his religion, and
turned Presbyterian, most of the inhabitants being of that
denomination: he travelled quite through the island, and then
crossed over a ferry into Block-island, from whence there are
great quantities of timber transported to the town of Boston.

Soon after, crossing another ferry, he came into New York, which
is a very fine city. There are now about one thousand one hundred
houses, and near seven thousand inhabitants in it. The houses are
well built, the meanest of them is said to be worth one hundred
pounds, which cannot be said of any city in England. The great
church here was built in the year 1695, and is a very handsome
edifice. Here are also a Dutch church, a French church, and a
Lutheran church. The inhabitants of the Dutch extraction make a
very considerable part of the town; but, most of them speaking
English, one may suppose they went pretty much to the great
church, especially all those that are and hope to be in offices.
Here he was surprised at the sight of a great number of gibbets,
with blacks hanging upon them; but, upon inquiring, he found the
negroes had not long before entered into a conspiracy for burning
the whole city; however, the plot being timely discovered, great
numbers were executed and hung up to terrify others. His first
care here was to inquire the names, circumstances, families, and
countries, of the principal inhabitants of the city; amongst the
rest he inquired out Captain Lush, who was formerly of Carmouth,
by Lime, in Dorsetshire, to whom he had recommendatory letters
from Mr. Matthews, of East Jersey. He was received very hospitably
by Captain Lush, who likewise gave him two shirts, and informed
him, there was no ship ready to sail for England there, but that
he would find one at New London. Having found there was one Mr.
Lucas, formerly of Taunton, in Somersetshire, in New York, and
judging he was brother to Mr. Lucas, of Brampton, in Devon, whom
he knew very well, he went boldly to his house, which was in the
fish-shambles, and knocking at the door, it was opened to him by a
negro; he enquired if Mr. Lucas was at home; and, before the negro
could give him an answer, out came Mr. Lucas with a little boy,
and demanded what he wanted: he replied he was an Englishman, born
in Devonshire, who had the misfortune to be cast away in a ship
behind Long-island, and hearing his name was Lucas, he had made
bold to apply to him for his assistance, as he was very well
acquainted with his brother, Mr. Lucas, of Brampton. Mr. Lucas
asked him, if he could tell him whom his brother married; he
replied, Mrs. Mary Tristam. Do you know Huntsham? Yes, replied he,
and Mr. Beer, who first courted Mrs. Tristam. And how many
children has my brother? To this likewise Mr. Carew answered very
exactly; and Mr. Lucas, being convinced by this of his being no
imposter, bid him come in, telling him, he expected his youngest
brother there in three weeks' time. He was entertained here very
generously, and at his departure Mr. Lucas gave him two guineas.

From thence he went through Seabrake and Seaford to New London,
which is situated on a river called the Thames. The first branch
of which river goes by the name of Glass river, the next branch by
that of Russel's Delight, and the third by that of Indian river.
There is a small river which falls into the sea at Manchester. The
trade of ship-building flourishes here. He now inquired if there
were none of the name of Davy in that city; and being asked why,
he replied, they were near heirs to a fine estate near Crediton in
Devon, formerly belonging to Sir John Davy. He was then shown to
two ancient sisters of Sir John Davy, whose sons were timber-men:
they asked a great many questions about the family, and he told
them that Sir John Davy was dead, and his eldest son also, who had
left two sons; that the youngest brother, Humphrey Davy, was then
living at Creedy-house, and the little boys somewhere about
Exeter. Then they gave him two letters to give to Mr. Humphrey
Davy; after which, each gave him a guinea, with recommendations to
one Justice Miller and Captain Rogers, who was bound for England.
Justice Miller received him very kindly, with whom he agreed to
take a run to England for ten gallons of rum, ten pounds of sugar,
ten pounds of tobacco, and ten pipes.

Chapter XV.
He Returns Home and Avoids the Press-gang by
Feigning Smallpox

Captain Rogers having taken in his lading, which consisted of
rice, tobacco, and pipe staves, set sail with a fair wind from New
London, and run to Lundy in a month and three days. Nothing
happened material on their voyage, and the sailors passed this
time very joyfully, having so favourable a gale; but our hero, who
knew that fortune, like a common jilt, often puts on the fairest
smiles when she is about to discard you, thought it prudent to
provide against her slippery tricks as much as lay in his power;
he therefore pricked his arms and breast with a needle, and then
rubbed it with bay salt and gunpowder, which made it appear like
the small-pox coming out; in the night-time he groaned very
dismally, till at length the captain called to him to know the
reason of his groaning so in his sleep. Alas! Sir, replied he, I
have been dreaming my poor wife was dead, and that she died of the
small-pox. Be of good cheer, man, says the captain, dreams are but
fables; and, for your comfort, I believe we shall quickly make
land: however, they did not do this as soon as the captain
expected; for, towards the next evening, the wind springing up a
fresh gale, the captain ordered to stand out to sea again: during
all the day, Mr. Carew did not stir out of his hammock, pretending
to be very ill. Towards the morning, the wind was somewhat laid,
and they stood in before it; but it being very hazy weather, the
captain ordered a good look-out, crying, my brave boys, take care
we don't run foul of some ship, for we are now in the channel. The
men replied, all is well.

Now the cocks began to crow on board, and Sol took his last
embrace of Thetis, to begin his daily stage; for, indeed, already
had his equipage waited near an hour for him. Reader, if thou art
acquainted with the inimitable history of Tom Jones, thou mayest
perhaps know what is meant by this; but, lest thou shouldest not,
we think it not improper to inform thee, that we mean no more than
what we might have told thee in three words, that it was broad
day-light. The captain called out, how goes the glass, my brave
boys? Eight glasses are just run, replied the men; then look out
sharp for land. Soon after, the cabin boy hallooing out, land,
land! the captain ran nimbly to see if it was so, saying, I am
afraid we are embayed. No, replied the mate, I will be bound for
it, it is Lundy-island. The captain ran up immediately to the
main-topmast head, to look out for other lands to the right and
left, and found it to be indeed Lundy-island; upon which several
sailors ran up the rigging, and, among the rest, Mr. Carew creeps
out with nothing but a blanket upon his shoulders, and makes an
attempt to run up the rigging; which the captain seeing, he
hastily cries out, where is old John going? take care of the old
man, he is light-headed: upon which, some of the sailors took him
down, and carried him back to his hammock. They then crowded all
the sail they could for Lundy. When they came near, they perceived
several ships laying at anchor there, and made a signal for a
pilot. Soon after comes up a pilot of Clovelly, who was then upon
the island, waiting to pilot ships up to Bristol. The captain
welcomed him on board, and agreed for seven guineas to be pilotted
up to Bristol: then the captain asked him what news, and if any
New-England men were gone up the channel? He replied, that none
had passed, but that he could inform him of bad news for his men,
which was, the Ruby man-of-war, Captain Goodyre, lay then in King-
road, and pressed all the men he could lay hold of. Mr. Carew,
hearing this, immediately comes upon deck, with his blanket upon
his shoulders, and pretended to vomit over the ship's side. The
pilot, observing him, asked what was the matter with the old man.
I believe, replies the captain, he has got the small-pox; he
dreamed the other night that his wife was dead of them, which
frightened him so much, that I think the small-pox is come out
upon him. The pilot then stepped up and asked him to let him look
upon him, which he complying with, and showing him his arms, the
pilot swore he had got the small-pox heavily upon him, and Mr.
Carew kept on groaning very mournfully. They then sailed by
Appledore, Biddeford, and Barnstaple, (where Mr. Carew,
notwithstanding his having the small-pox so heavily, wished
himself on shore, drinking some of their fat ale,) so to the
Holmes, and into King-road early in the morning. He then thought
it advisable to take a pretty large quantity of warm water into
his belly, and soon after, to their concern, they saw the Ruby
man-of-war lying in the road, with jack, ensign, and pendant
hoisted.

Now were all the sailors, who had been so jovial before, struck
with a dreadful panic; but our hero, secure of the favour and
protection of the goddess prudence, was quite easy at heart. Soon
they perceived the man of war's boat making towards them, upon
which Mr. Carew grew sicker and sicker: the captain ordered the
ropes to be flung out for a man-of-war's boat, and the stanchions
and red ropes to be got ready for the lieutenant, as though they
had been to receive some good visitor on board; such are the
polished arts of the world; for we think we may venture to say,
that both the captain and the crew, at the time they were making
these preparations to receive the lieutenant, had rather have seen
him gone to the bottom of the sea, than come on board their
vessel. At length the man-of-war's boat came along side of the
ship, when Mr. Carew went down into the steerage with his belly
full of hot water, and the lieutenant came on board. Sir, you are
welcome on board, says the captain; or, rather, that little part
of the captain called the tongue; for the heart, mind, and every
other particle, of the captain wished him at the d—l at the same
time. The lieutenant inquired from whence they came and what
passage. The captain replied, from Boston, in a month and four
days; and then asked him to walk aft, and take a drop of rum; but,
before he did so, the lieutenant asked how many hands there were
on board. The captain answered, he had only fifteen, for men were
very scarce. Of what burden is your ship?—Two hundred and fifty
tons. I must have your hands, sir, said the lieutenant: come in,
barge crew, and do your duty. No sooner were the words spoken,
than the crew leaped upon the deck, and the lieutenant ordered all
the ship's company aft, saying he wanted to talk with them. He
then accosted them with an oratorial harangue: "Gentlemen
sailors," said he, "I make no doubt but you are willing to enter
voluntarily, and not as pressed men; if you go like brave men,
freely, when you come round to Plymouth and Portsmouth, and get on
board your respective ships, you will have your bounty money, and
liberty to go on shore and kiss your landladies." Though this
oration was pronounced with as much self-applause as Cicero felt
when, by the force of his eloquence, he made Caesar the master of
the world to tremble; or as the vehement Demosthenes, when used to
thunder against king Philip; yet we are not quite certain whether
it was the power of eloquence alone persuaded the men to enter
voluntarily, or whether being seated between the two rocks of
Scylla and Charybdis, it was indifferent to them which they dashed
upon; however this was, all but one of them entered (though with
sad hearts) without being pressed, which we make no doubt the
lieutenant attributed to the eloquence of his oration.

The lieutenant observing a stout fellow, in a frock and trowsers,
who did not come aft with the other men, asked the captain who he
was. The captain replied, he was an Indian, and a brave sailor, so
called him by his name. Wat ye want wit mee, replies the Indian,
mee wont come, dammee. Upon which the lieutenant sent some of the
barge crew to bring him forward which the brave Indian perceiving,
he caught hold of a handspike, and put himself in a posture of
defence, crying out to the barge crew who came up towards him,
dammee, ye meddle wit mee, mee dash your brains out. The crew,
finding him resolute, did not think proper to attack him: upon
which the lieutenant asked him, if he would serve king George. Dam
king George, mee know no king George: mee be an Indian, mee have a
king in my own country, whom mee love and fightee for, because he
be de very good king: at which the lieutenant and captain fell a
laughing, and left him.

Are these all your men? says the lieutenant. Yes, replied the
captain, except an old man, who dreamed the other night that his
wife died of the small-pox, and was so much frightened, that the
small-pox is come out upon him. The captain then ordered the bills
to be made for what was due to the men, and asked the lieutenant
in the mean while to walk down and taste his rum. Accordingly down
comes the lieutenant, humming a tune. Mr. Carew, hearing this,
prepared himself, and, taking an opportunity of putting his finger
down his throat, discharges his stomach just under the
lieutenant's feet, crying out in a most lamentable tone at the
same time, O, my head! O my back! What! cried the lieutenant very
hastily, is this the fellow who has the small-pox? No, no, replied
Carew; I have had the small-pox many years ago, and have been with
Sir Charles Wager and Sir George Walton up the Baltic; and now,
for God's sake, take me on board your ship, noble captain, for I
want only to be blooded. The lieutenant whipped out his snuff box,
and clapped it to his nose, swearing, he would not take him on
board for five hundred pounds, for he was enough to infect a whole
ship's crew; that the devil should take him before he would—
hurrying at the same time as fast as he could into the great
cabin. When he came there, Mr. Carew heard him complaining how
unfortunate it was that he should come on board, as he had never
had the small-pox himself. When the rest of the men had had their
bills made out, the captain, willing to get rid of Mr. Carew, said
to him, come, old John, I will have your bill made to; which was
accordingly done, and it amounted to seven pounds ten shillings,
for which the captain gave him a draught on merchant Tidiate of
Bristol. The captain then ordered the boat to put him on shore;
but he besought the captain to let him die on board. No, no, says
the captain; by all means take him on shore. Ay, ay, says the
lieutenant, take him on shore. Then the captain called to some of
the sailors, to help the poor old man over the side of the ship,
and out came Mr. Carew, with the blanket wrapped about his
shoulders, and so well did he counterfeit, that he seemed a most
deplorable object of compassion. The boat having got a little
distance from the ship, was called back again, and the lieutenant
tossed him half-a-guinea, charging him not to go into the city of
Bristol, as he was enough to infect the whole city.


Chapter XVI
He Revisits Some Old Friends

Thus our hero, after seeing many cities and men, undergoing great
hardships, and encountering many dangers and difficulties, once
more set foot on his beloved country. Notwithstanding the joy he
felt at being safe on shore, he did not lay aside his small-pox,
but travelled on towards Bristol as one very bad in that
distemper. Coming to Justice Cann's, near Derham Downs, he met
with the gardener, whom he asked if the justice lived there, and
was at home? Being told he was, he made a most lamentable moan,
and said, he was just come from New England, and had the small-pox
on him. The gardener went into the house, and, soon returning,
told him the justice was not at home; but gave him half-a-crown.
He still kept crying, I am a dying man, and I beseech you let me
lie and die in some hay-tallet, or any place of shelter. The
gardener, seeing him so ill, went in again, and brought out a
cordial dram, and a mug of warm ale, which Mr. Carew made shift to
swallow. The gardener then left him, being so much affrighted at
his appearance and lamentable moans, that he let both glass and
mug fall to the ground, before he reached the house. Mr. Carew
then made a shift, notwithstanding his dying condition, to reach
the city of Bristol; and being now freed from his apprehensions of
being pressed, at the first barber's he came to he got rid of his
beard, and bid adieu to the small-pox; he then made the best of
his way to the mendicants' hall, on Mile-hill. Just as he came
there, the landlady and an old crony, a tinker's wife, were
standing at the door; as soon as the landlady espied him, she
clapped her hands, and swore it was either Mr. Carew or his ghost.
As soon as they were convinced he was flesh and blood, great were
the kisses, hugs, and embraces, of the three. Our hero's first
inquiry was, when they had seen his dear Polly, meaning his wife:
the landlady told him she had not seen her lately, but had heard
that she and his daughter were well; but that his wife never
expected to see him more.

Mr. Carew soon called for a room above stairs, ordered an elegant
dinner to be provided, and passed the afternoon very merrily. The
next morning he waited on the merchant with his bill, and received
the money for it; then weighed anchor, and steered for
Bridgewater, where he arrived at night. He immediately repaired to
a mumper's house, kept by a one-eyed woman, named Laskey, from
whence he went to the Swan, where several gentlemen were passing
the evening together, viz. Mr. More, Dr. Deptford, Counsellor
Bedford, and others, all of whom were particularly acquainted with
him; however, he pretended to be a West Indian who had been cast
away in a ship, coming from Antigua, which foundered behind Cape
Clear; that he was taken up by an Irishman, and afterwards put on
board a Bristol ship. Having by this story raised a handsome
contribution from the gentlemen, he discovered himself, knowing
them to be his good friends; but the gentlemen could scarcely
credit him, till he gave them sufficient proofs of his being the
real Bampfylde-Moore Carew.

The next morning he went to Sir John Tynte, and made the same
complaint he had done the night before at the Swan in Bridgewater:
the servant telling him Sir John would come forth soon, he waited
till he did so, and then discovered himself; Sir John would not
believe him, but at last made him a present. He afterwards visited
Justice Grose, of Bromfylde, who presently knew him, and made him
very welcome; from whence, setting out for Exeter, he visited on
the road Mr. John Bampfylde, of Hesticomb, the Rev. Mr. Boswell,
and Dr. Hildyard, of Taunton, the Rev. Mr. Manifee, Squire Bluet,
of Melcombe Regis, the Rev. Mr. Newt, of Tiverton, Squire Blundel,
and Major Worth, in the neighbourhood of that place, who, being
all his particular friends, were very glad to see him return, and
treated him very handsomely. Major Worth took him a-hunting with
him: but he soon found an opportunity of slipping away, and
directed his steps to his own parish of Bickley. Here he happened
to meet Lady Carew; but so great was his respect for her, that he,
who used to attempt everything, had not courage to accost this
lady, and therefore turned off to a place called Codbury, the seat
of Mr. Fursdon. As soon as he came there, he was known to Mr.
Fursdon's sister, who told him he should not stir thence till her
brother came home; soon after Mr. Fursdon returned, and brought
with him one Mr. Land, of Silverton: he was very much surprised to
see him, and treated him very generously, making him a very
handsome present, as did also Mr. Land. He abode there that night,
went a-hunting with Mr. Fursdon the next day, and likewise to see
Mr. Bampfylde Rode, at Stoke, who would not believe Mr. Carew had
been in America; he treated him handsomely, and made him a present
at his departure. He came next into Exeter, the place he had
sailed from to Maryland, and going into St. Peter's church-yard,
saw Sir Henry Northcote, Dr. Andrews, and two other gentlemen, who
were walking there; he accosted them with a God bless you, Sir
Harry, Dr. Andrews, and the rest of the company. Sir Harry,
staring very wistfully at him, cried, are you flesh and blood? why
you can never have been in America. Dr. Andrews then asked if it
was Carew; and the report being spread that he was in Exeter, it
drew a number of spectators to see him; and amongst the rest
merchant Davy himself, who asked him, in a very great hurry, if
the ship was cast away. No, no, said he, I have been in America,
have had the honour of seeing your factor, Mr. Mean, and saw
Griffiths sold for a thousand weight of tobacco: did I not tell
you that I would be at home before Captain Froade? He then gave an
account of several particulars, which convinced the gentlemen he
had really been in America. Mr. Davy asked him, if he had been
sold before he ran away; and he replying he had not, the merchant
told him jeeringly, that he was his servant still, that he should
charge him five pounds for his passage, and five pounds for costs
and charges, besides Captain Froade's bill. He next inquired where
he had left Captain Froade. Mr. Carew told him he had left him in
Miles's river. The gentlemen then gave him money, as did likewise
merchant Davy.

Two months after this came home Captain Froade, laden with
tobacco. As soon as he came to an anchor, several gentlemen of
Exeter went on board, and inquired what passage, and where he left
Mr. Carew? Damn him, replied the captain, you will never see him
again: he ran away, was taken, put into New Town gaol, brought
back again, and whipped, had a pot-hook put upon him, ran away
with it on his neck, and has never been heard of since; so that,
without doubt, he must either be killed by some wild beast, or
drowned in some river. At this the gentlemen fell a-laughing,
telling the captain he had been at home two months before him.
Captain Froade swore it could never be; however, they confirmed it
to him that it was so.

Soon after this Mr. Carew went and paid his respects to Sir
William Courtenay, returning him many thanks for what he had
furnished him with when he sailed for Maryland; adding, he had
been as good as his word, in coming home before Captain Froade.
Sir William told him he thought he had; and then called to his
butler to give him something to drink. In a little time Sir
William came to him again, with his brother, Mr. Henry Courtenay,
who conducted him to a noble parlour, where was a great company of
fine ladies sitting, whom our hero accosted with all that respect
which is ever due to beauty and merit. Sir William then asked him
jocosely if he could find out which was his dove. He replied, he
knew some of the ladies there; and that, unless his judgment
deceived him, such a lady, (singling out one of them) was the
happy person. You are right, replied Sir William; this is indeed
my dove, and turtle-dove. Sir William then put a piece of money in
his hat, as did Mr. Courtenay, and bid him go round to the ladies,
which he did, addressing them in a very handsome manner; and, we
need not add, gathered a plentiful harvest, as the fair sex are,
in general, so much inclined to humanity and good-nature. Sir
William asked him if he would not drink to the ladies' health? and
filled him up a bumper of excellent wine; he then took his leave
of this truly noble and hospitable gentleman.—Here, reader, if my
pen were equal to the task, I would describe to you one whom, in
this degenerate age, thou mayest gaze at as a prodigy; one who,
like the phœnix rising from the ashes of his father, inherits all
the virtues of his glorious ancestors; I would describe to you
magnificence without extravagance, pomp without ostentation,
plenty without luxury or riot, and greatness undiminished by
little pride; I would set before you something more than a king,
surrounded and imprisoned by worthless and impervious favourites,
fawning sycophants, and tasteless grandeur. Such are the scenes
within thy walls, such thy master, happy Powderham![Note:
Powderham is the seat of Sir William Courtney, near Exon.]


Chapter XVII
He Returns to his Impostures

From hence our hero went to Squire Bell's, of Mamheap; in the way
he met with Mr. Jackson, his steward, who was lame with the gout;
he presently knew Mr. Carew, gave him half-a-crown, and told him,
he would hop back on his crutches to give him something to drink.
While they were drinking a glass, the steward advised him to make
application to the squire. Presently after, he came out, and Mr.
Carew soon began his attack upon him. Pray, who are you? said the
justice. I am a poor unfortunate West Indian, replied he, who has
been shipwrecked on the coast of Ireland, and was taken up by a
Bristol ship. Ay, ay, you are one of Carew's gang, I suppose, said
the justice, but he is transported. Bless your honour, returned
he, I am no impostor; I have heard that he was a very great one,
and I think deserved more than transportation. Well, well, there's
a shilling for you, replied the justice, and go about your
business.

From hence he steered towards Mr. Oxenham's, at New-house: when he
came near the house, he pulled off his shirt, and gave it to an
old man he met, as though he had been amazed: then marched up to
the house, and just at the stable met Mrs. Oxenham and another
lady, whom he immediately accosted with a doleful complaint of
being a poor shipwrecked mariner. Mrs. Oxenham told him, she
should have taken him for Bampfylde-Moore Carew, but she knew him
to be transported. He was not disconcerted at this, but readily
told her, with great composure, that his name was Thomas Jones,
belonging to Bridport, in Dorsetshire. The ladies gave each a
shilling, and then bid him to go into the house, where he had
victuals set before him; before he went away the lady sent him a
Holland shirt. Being thus equipped, he inquired out the
churchwardens of the parish, and by the same story got a crown of
them. From hence he went to Lord Clifford's, at Uggbroke, in the
parish of Chudleigh: here he sent in a petition to my Lord as an
unfortunate Roman Catholic, and received a guinea; he lay that
night at Sandy-gate, and behaved as a Roman Catholic, under the
name of William Passmore.

The next day, at Moll Upton's, in Newton Bushel, he met with one
of the sisters of that order of mendicants commonly called cousin
Betties; and he, having an inclination to pay a visit to Sir
Thomas Carew, at Hackum, soon made an agreement with the cousin
Betty to exchange habits for that day. The barber was then called
in to make his beard as smooth as his art and razor could make it,
and his hair was dressed up with ribbons; thus metamorphosed, our
hero set out, having a little dog under his arm. Being come to Sir
Thomas Carew's, he rushed into the house without ceremony,
demanding his rent in an imperious tone. None of the men-servants
being in the way, the women first ran one way and then another;
but he, taking notice of this confusion, continued to act the mad
woman, beating his head against the wall, kissing the dog, and
demanding his rent; at last, one of the women-servants came out,
crying, lady, you are welcome to the rent, and gave him a crown;
but he was not to be removed so easily, for now he fell a raving
again, and demanded some merry-go-down; they then brought him some
ale, which having drunk, he took his leave, thanking them with a
very low courtesy. From hence he returned in his progress to
parson Sandford's, of Stoke, in Tinney, where, having entered the
house with as little ceremony as before, he not only demanded his
rent, as usual, but a gown for some of his cousins: neither would
he take his leave till he had got a shilling for rent, a good
gown, and some pinners. He next called upon parson Richards, at
Coombe, in Tinney, where he got a shilling and a shift. Having
thus succeeded in his new adventure, he returned to his quarters
at mother Upton's, in Newton-Bushel, where he divided the profits
of the day with his good cousin Betty, and also passed the night
very merrily with her.

The next day he restored his borrowed accoutrements to cousin
Betty, and, calling for a pen and ink, wrote a petition in the
character of a poor unfortunate soap-boiler, whose house was set
on fire by the carelessness of an apprentice, in the parish of
Monksilver, not forgetting to sign it with the names of several
neighbouring gentlemen. With this fictitious petition he went to
Justice Taylor's, at Dembury, where he was handsomely relieved:
thence he went to Justice Neil's, and finding upon inquiry the
justice himself was at home, he did not venture to deliver his
petition, but begged as an unfortunate man, and was relieved with
a cup of cider, and some bread and cheese. At Darlington he
assumed the character of a rat-catcher, and sold a receipt to a
gentleman's steward for a crown: and under this character he
travelled forward to Plymouth. Here, learning that there was to be
a great cock-match, he laid aside his rat-catcher's habit, and put
on that of a gentleman, and not the habit only, as too many do,
but the manners and behaviour likewise. At the cock-match, he
betted several wagers with Sir Coventry Carew, and his own brother
Mr. Henry Carew, the minister of Saltash, which he had the good
fortune to win, and left the cock-pit undiscovered by anyone. Thus
great is the power of dress, which transforms and metamorphoses
the beggar into a gentleman, and the cinder wench into a fine
lady; therefore let not the little great (I mean those who have
nothing to recommend them but their equipage) pride themselves as
though they had something superior in them to the poor wretch they
spurn with so much contempt; for, let me tell them, if we are apt
to pay them respect, they are solely indebted for it to the mercer
and tailor; strip them of their gaudy plumes, and we shall not be
able to distinguish them from the lowest order of mumpers. This
puts us in mind of a remarkable adventure of our hero's life,
which he always told with a great deal of pleasure.


Chapter XVIII
He Joins Forces with a Fellow-beggar who is not
what he Seems

One day, as he was begging in the town of Maiden Bradley, from
door to door, as a poor shipwrecked seaman, he saw on the other
side of the street a mendicant brother-sailor, in a habit as
forlorn as his own, begging for God's sake, just like himself.
Seeing Mr. Carew, he crossed the way, came up to him, and in the
cant language, asked where he lay last night, what road he was
going, and several other questions; then, whether he would brush
into a boozing-ken and be his thrums; to this he consented, and
away they went; where, in the course of their conversation, they
asked each other various questions concerning the country, the
charitable and uncharitable families, the moderate and severe
justices, the good and queer corporations. This new acquaintance
of Mr. Carew's asked him if he had been at Sir Edward Seymour's?
He answered, yes, and had received his alms: the stranger,
therefore, not having been there, left him at the alehouse, and
went thither himself, where, having received the same alms that
his new companion had, he returned to him again.

The next day they begged through the town, one on one side of the
street, and the other on the other, each on his own separate story
and account: they then proceeded to the houses of several
gentlemen in the neighbourhood, both in one story, which was that
of the stranger. Among many others, they came to Lord Weymouth's,
where it was agreed that Mr. Carew should be spokesman: upon their
coming up to the house, the servants bid them begone, unless they
could give a good account of themselves and the countries in which
they pretended to have been, for, should Lord Weymouth come and
detect them in any falsehood, he would horse-whip them without
mercy, which was the treatment to all those whom he found to be
counterfeits met with from him, and he had detected great numbers
of them, having been abroad himself. Our travellers were not the
least daunted, Mr. Carew being conscious in himself that he could
give a satisfactory account of Newfoundland, and the other
affirming that he had been at Rome, France, Spain, Portugal,
Italy, &c. and could give as good a description of those countries
as his lordship himself. Therefore up they went to the kitchen
door, and Mr. Carew broke ice, telling the deplorable story of
their misfortune in his usual lamentable tone. The housekeeper at
first turned a deaf ear to their supplication and entreaty; but
Mr. Carew, at the instigation of his companion, redoubled his
importunity, kneeling on one knee, and making use of all the
methods of exciting charity, of which he was capable; so that at
last the housekeeper gave them the greatest part of a cold
shoulder of mutton, half a fine wheaten loaf, and a shilling, but
did it with great haste and fear, lest his lordship should see
her, and be angry. Of the butler they got a copper of good ale,
and then, both expressing their thankfulness, departed.—Having
reached some distance from the house there arose a dispute who
should carry the victuals, both being loath to encumber themselves
with it, as having neither wife nor child near to give it to. Mr.
Carew was for throwing it into the hedge, but the other urged that
it was both a sin and a shame to waste good victuals in that
manner, so they both agreed to go to the Green Man, about a mile
from my lord's, and there exchange it for liquor. At this alehouse
they tarried for some time, and snacked the argot; then, after a
parting glass, each went his way.

The reader cannot but be surprised when we assure him that this
mendicant companion of his was no less a person than my Lord
Weymouth himself, who, being desirous of sounding the tempers and
dispositions of the gentlemen and other inhabitants of the
neighbourhood, put himself into a habit so vastly beneath his
birth and fortune, in order to obtain that discovery. Nor was this
the first time that this great nobleman had metamorphosed himself
into the despicable shape and character of a beggar, as several of
that neighbourhood can testify; but, when he went abroad into the
world in this disguise, he took especial care to conceal it even
from his own family, one servant only, in whose secrecy he greatly
confided, being entrusted therewith; and this was his valet-de-
chambre, who used to dress, shave, and perform other such offices
about his lordship's person.

Mr. Carew and his noble companion having thus parted from each
other, he took his way into the woodlands towards Frome; and the
disguised lord, by a private way through the park and gardens,
returned to his own house, and there, divesting himself of his
rags, put on his embroidered apparel, and re-assumed the dignity
and state to which both his birth and fortune entitled him. I am 
informed, said his lordship, that two sailors have been at my
house; and, inquiring which way they went, he ordered two men and
horses to go after them, with a strict charge to bring them back
to his house, for he had heard they were impostors; and, if he
found them such, he would treat them accordingly. The servants
obeyed his commands without the least suspicion of the intricacy
of this affair, and soon came up with Mr. Carew, whom they
forcibly brought up to my lord. His lordship accosted him in a
very rough stern manner, asking where the other fellow was, and
told him he should be made to find him. Mr. Carew in the meantime
stood thunder-struck, expecting nothing less than a commitment to
prison, but, upon examination, made out his story as well as he
could.

After having thus terrified and threatened him for a considerable
time, his lordship went out, and, divesting himself of the habit
and character of a nobleman, again put on his rags, and was, by
his trusty valet-de-chambre, ushered into the room where his
brother-beggar stood sweating for fear, when they compared notes
together, whispering to each other what to say, in order that
their accounts might agree when examined apart, as in effect they
were. The steward took Mr. Carew aside into a private chamber, and
there pretending that the other fellow's relation contradicted
his, and proved them both to be counterfeits, he said that a
prison must be the portion of both; and indeed nothing was omitted
that might strike Mr. Carew with the greatest terror and
confusion. By this time my lord having thrown off his rags, and
put on his fine apparel, Mr. Carew was again brought into his
presence to receive his final sentence; when his lordship, having
sufficiently diverted himself with the fear and consternation of
his brother mumper discovered himself to him.

We might have mentioned before, that, while my lord and Mr. Carew
travelled together, they asked each other whence they came, and
what their names were. Mr. Carew ingeniously confessed his, but my
lord disguised both his name and country; so that having
accidentally met with a mendicant of the greatest note in England,
his lordship thought fit to treat him in the manner aforesaid,
which he would not have done to every common vagrant.—However, to
satisfy himself that this was the famous and true Bampfylde-Moore
Carew, for many impostors had usurped his name, he sent for
Captain Atkins, a gentleman of his acquaintance in the
neighbourhood, who went to school with Mr. Carew at Tiverton. This
gentleman was very glad to see his old school-fellow, and assured
his lordship that it was really Mr. Bampfylde-Moore Carew, upon
which his lordship very nobly entertained him at his house for the
space of three days, and gave him an excellent suit of clothes and
ten guineas; but, remembering the trouble they had, and the loss
they were at to dispose of the shoulder of mutton and bread which
the housekeeper had given them, as likewise the resolution Mr.
Carew had once taken to throw it away, he called his housekeeper,
and strictly charged her never to give away a morsel of victuals
more, but bestow the alms in money only, rightly judging that to
be more acceptable to beggars than the best of provisions, the
greatest part of which they either waste, give away, or exchange
for an inconsiderable quantity of drink, as my lord and Mr. Carew
had done. His lordship took Mr. Carew to Warminster horse-races,
and there recommended him to many honourable gentlemen, who were
very liberal to him. He several times after made bold to call upon
his lordship in his rounds, and at every visit received a guinea,
and a hearty welcome at his house. His lordship would frequently
make himself merry with the story, and jocosely say, that he was
more expert in the science of mumping than even Mr. Carew himself.


Chapter XIX
He meets with the Captains who Helped him Escape;
He Sleeps in a Haunted House; His Revenge on the
Bellman

Not long after this, Mr. Carew came to Biddeford again, where he
had been some time before, and delivered the compass to Captain
Haley's wife, who immediately burst into tears upon seeing it,
supposing her husband was dead: he then went to the Dolphin,
where, as he was drinking, he saw some gentlemen in the Butchers'
Row, and asked the landlord who they were. Being told they were
the Captains Harvey, Hopkins, and Burd,—Go, said he, and give my
duty, and tell them Mr. Bampfylde-Moore Carew is at your house.
The landlord went accordingly, and soon returned with the
captains. They were glad to see our hero, who returned them thanks
for the favours he had received from them in America. The captains
asked him a great many questions respecting his travels through
the Indians' country, &c., and told him they never thought he
could have gone through that dangerous undertaking, but expected
to have seen him return again. He then gave them an account of
everything to their satisfaction, telling them he had followed
their directions in every point. They afterwards treated him very
handsomely, and made a collection for him. The captains then going
out, and reporting that he was in town, a great concourse of
people assembled to see him, to the no little profit of the
landlord; for our hero ordered that no one should be admitted to
see him, till he had first drunk a quart of ale in the house.

Some time after this, he disguised himself like a poor miserable
decrepit old man, and took to selling of matches and gathering old
rags. Happening to meet a brother ragman at Wiveliscombe, they
joined company, and agreed to travel to Porlock together. Just as
they came to Gutter-Hall, night coming on a-pace, they proposed
taking up their quarters there. The landlord told them he had no
lodging to spare, but if they would go half-a-mile farther, and
lie in a haunted house, they should have their lodging free cost,
and good bread, cheese, and cider, with a rasher of bacon into the
bargain. The ragmen very readily accepted this offer, and,
accompanied by the landlord, repaired to Farmer Liddon's house.
When they came there the landlord told the farmer he had brought
two men who would lie in the haunted house. The farmer received
them very gladly, and asked them if they were sure they had
courage enough to do it, adding he would give them twenty
shillings if they could lay the old woman. Never fear, farmer,
replied Mr. Carew; we have not only courage to speak to, but
learning enough to lay, the old woman, so that you shall never
hear of her more. Things being thus agreed on, the farmer's son, a
great stout fellow, willing to show his courage, in a very bold
manner offered to keep them company. Having provided themselves
with firing, cider, bread, cheese, and bacon, they adjourned to
the haunted house, but not before Mr. Carew had taken an
opportunity of going into the yard, and filling his pockets with
large stones. When they came to the haunted house, they made a
good fire, and he and his companion sat down, eating and drinking
very merrily; but the farmer's son, beginning to have some terrors
upon him, had little stomach to eat. About the middle of the
night, when everything is most silent and solemn, at that time
when every whisper of the mind is apt to create fear, Mr. Carew
took an opportunity of throwing a stone unseen up the stairs,
which, coming rumbling down again with a frightful noise, might
have at that time struck a panic into the most courageous heart.
The farmer's son turned pale, and leaped from his chair in a great
fright, believing that the old woman was making her entrance; but
nothing appearing, the same awful silence and stillness as before
took place, only fear staid behind in the farmer's breast, and Mr.
Carew and his companion kept mute, as though in expectation of
what would follow; but soon this solemn silence was disturbed by a
loud thump at the door; again the farmer leaped from his seat,
crying out, O Lord! save and deliver us! At the same time, unable
to command those passages at which fear is apt to issue out, he
caused a smell almost as bad as Satan himself is said to bring
along with him. Mr. Carew caught him in his arms, and, holding his
head close to his breast, cried, don't be afraid, Mr. Liddon, for
I will make the old woman fly; at the same time, pretending to
conjure her, he repeated three times very solemnly, Hight spirito
diabolico rubro oceano, whilst his companion went a little aside,
and answered in a squeaking tone, like Joan Liddon, unless my will
is fulfilled, I will tear them in pieces!

Soon after cock-crowing, there was another huge blow at the door,
and then they bid the farmer look up, telling him the old woman
was gone; however, he would not let go his hold of Mr. Carew. Just
as day-light appeared, his companion went forth, and picked up the
stones from the stairs, entry, &c. He had scarce done this, before
the old farmer came down, to see if his son was alive, and if they
had seen old Joan. He accosted them with, How do you do? how have
you spent the night? O father, replied the son, most terribly
indeed. You can't conceive what rattlings and noises we heard; but
this good man secured me in his arms. But what smell is this?
replied the father; sure old Joan stinks of brimstone, or
something worse, if she brought this along with her. Ay, father,
father, said the son, I believe you would have raised as bad a
smell as I have done, if you had been here. Well, well, said the
father, perhaps I might; but have you spoken to old Joan? Yes,
indeed, replied Mr. Carew. And what does the old woman say? She
says, if her will is not exactly fulfilled as she desired, she
will never leave haunting you; but, if it be, all shall be well
and quiet. They then went to the farmer's house, where they were
made very welcome, and received the twenty shillings, according to
promise, the farmer requesting they would stay the next night by
themselves, for he believed his son would have no stomach to go
with them, and tell the old woman everything should be fulfilled
according to her will, and they should be satisfied to their
content. They accordingly passed the next night there very
merrily, and received another twenty shillings in the morning,
which was well bestowed too by the farmer; for ever after the
house had the reputation of being quiet.

Mr. Carew and his companion then set forward for Porlock, where
they parted company; and Mr. Carew coming into Porlock, met Dr.
Tanner, a relation of old Joan Liddon's, and his brother, Parson
Tanner, who was with him. After the usual salutations, he very
composedly asked if they had heard the news of the conjuring old
Joan? The doctor replied they had heard something of it, and that
he was resolved either to send or take a ride over himself, to
inquire into the truth of it. He confirmed it to them, which
occasioned a great deal of discourse about it, and who these two
conjurers could be.

We should, perhaps, have passed over in silence this adventure of
our hero's, but that an author of the first rate has taken a great
deal of pains to frighten a poor soldier, and entertain his
readers by dressing up his hero in a white coloured coat, covered
with streams of blood [Note: Vide History of Tom Jones]; though we
cannot well conceive how those streams of blood, which ran down
the coat in the morning, should appear so very visible twenty
hours after, in the middle of the night, and at a distance by the
light of a single candle; notwithstanding this great author has
very judiciously acquainted us with a light-coloured coat; but
however this may be, we are of opinion that the farmer's son in
the above adventure is a more entertaining character than the
soldier in the renowned history we are speaking of; and that our
hero, whenever it was needful, could make a much more tremendous
figure than Mr. Jones in his white-coloured coat covered with
streams of blood. The following is a sufficient instance.

Mr. Carew being in the town of Southmolton, in Devon, and having
been ill used by a great officer, vulgarly called the bellman, was
resolved to take comical revenge. It was about that time reported
and generally believed, that a gentleman of the town, lately
buried, walked by night in the church-yard; and, as the bellman
was obliged by his nightly duty to go through it just at the hour
of one, that well-known accustomed time of spectres issuing from
their graves, Mr. Carew repaired there a little before the time,
and, stripping to his shirt, lay down upon the gentleman's grave.
Soon after, hearing the bellman approach, he raised himself up
with a solemn slowness; which the bellman beholding, by the
glimmering light of the moon through some thick clouds, he was
harrowed up (as Shakspeare expresses it) with fear and wonder, and
an universal palsy seized every limb; but, as nature most commonly
dictates flight in all such cases, he retreated with as much haste
as his shaking limbs would allow; yet, as fear naturally inclines
us to look back upon the object we are flying from, he several
times cast his eyes behind him, and beheld the ghost follow him
with a solemn march. This added fresh vigour to his flight, so
that he tumbled over graves and stones, not without many bruises,
and at length dropped his bell, which the ghost seized upon as
trophy, and forbore any farther pursuit. The bellman, however, did
not stop till he reached home, where he obstinately affirmed he
had seen the gentleman's ghost, who had taken away his bell, which
greatly alarmed the whole town; and there were not wanting many
who afterwards frequently heard the ghost ringing the bell in the
church-yard.

It was some time before the bellman had the courage to resume his
usual nightly rounds through the church-yard; but after a while,
his fear abating, he ventured upon it again, and met with no
interruption. Mr. Carew happening about a year afterwards to be in
Southmolton again, was afresh insulted by the bellman, which made
him resolve to give him a second meeting in the church-yard;
taking therefore the opportunity of a very dark night, he dressed
himself in a black gown, put a great fur cap upon his head, and at
the usual time of the bellman coming, repaired to the church-yard,
holding in his mouth, by the middle, a stick lighted at both ends,
at the same time rattling a heavy iron chain. If the bellman's
terror before was great, it was now much greater; and indeed the
appearance, joined to the rattling of the chain, was so hideous,
that the boldest soldier might have been terrified by it, without
any imputation of cowardice. The bellman fled away with all the
wings of fear, the spectre following him at a distance, rattling
the chain with a most hideous noise; hence the bellman concluded
himself to be haunted by the devil, and declined ever after his
nocturnal employment.


Chapter XX
More Adventures in Beggary and Imposture

About this time Mr. Carew met with one Mr. Philips, a celebrated
limner in Porlock, who showed him a great many pictures of
different likenesses, and asked him if he knew any of them. He
pointed out his old school-fellow, Edward Dyke, Esq., and Sir
Thomas Carew. Mr. Philips then asked him if he would sit for his
picture, as he had been desired to draw it for Mr. Copplestone
Bampfylde; which our hero agreeing to, he went the next day, and
the following, to sit for the picture, undisguised. When it was
finished, Mr. Philips desired him to come again another time in
his mumping dress, which he accordingly promised to do.

After this he went to Minehead, and called on several of his old
acquaintance, viz. Dr. Bell, Parson Beer, and the Collector, who
all treated him very kindly. Having raised contributions from
these gentlemen, he repaired to his quarters, and desired them to
lend him a pair of trowsers. Having a mind to try some of the
neighbouring country parishes, he pretended to be a cast-away
seaman, 3500 miles from home, and picked up a great deal of money,
and seven or eight pounds of bacon, which he brought to his
quarters, and gave as a recompense for the loan of the trowsers.

Some days after he met with an old female acquaintance, who had a
young child with her, at a place called Embercombe, with whom
joining company, they came into Dunster, and lay at private
lodgings. The next day, being willing to indulge his companion, he
borrowed her child, a gown, and one of her petticoats. Thus
accoutred, with the child in his arms, he returned to Minehead
among the gentlemen he had so lately received contributions from;
and pretending to be an unfortunate woman, whose house had been
burnt at Chadleigh, and giving a good account of that place and
its inhabitants to those who questioned him, coughing very
violently, and making the child cry, he got a great deal of money,
clothes for the child, and victuals. On his return to Dunster, he
gave the mother of the child the clothes, and the greatest part of
the money he had obtained in his trip; neither was this method new
to him, for he had long before this taught his own daughter, a
little infant, to say, Drowned in a boat, as often as he or any
other person asked her what was become of her mother, or mammy.
Having made her perfect in this lesson, he set out with her upon
his back, and pretended to have been a sailor on board a vessel
that had been lately lost on the coast of Wales, when most of the
ship's crew and passengers were drowned, among whom, he said, was
the mother of the tender infant at his back, and that he had saved
himself and the infant by swimming. By this story he pocketed a
great deal of money everywhere, especially, as by way of
confirmation, when he was telling of it, he would turn and ask the
babe, where is your poor mammy, my dear, my jewel? To which the
babe would reply, drowned in the boat; which so affected all that
heard it, that it not only drew their purse but their tears also.

From Dunster he went through the country to Ilfracombe, where he
inquired for a passage to Ireland. He was told there was no vessel
going to Ireland, but that he might have a passage for Wales,
which he soon resolved upon, and, after waiting upon the collector
and some other friends in Ilfracombe, set sail for Swansea. He had
no sooner landed there, than he repaired to the Rev. Mr. Griffy of
that place, in the character of a cast-away seaman, a native of
Devonshire; and, as he gave a particular account of Mr. Griffy's
son, the minister of Bishop's Nympton, he was made very welcome,
and handsomely relieved, and by his recommendations obtained a
great deal of money in the town.

From thence he went in the same character to Lord Mansell's, at
Cowbridge, and other places, and returned to Swansea. Thence he
set out again, travelling through the country to Tenby, where,
hearing of one Captain Lott, he waited upon him with the same
story, but with the addition of his name being John Lott, whereby
he soon got half-a-crown and a good welcome. [Note: Mr. Carew had
some time before this enlisted himself to Captain Lott. and left
him the next day, taking with him an extraordinary fine spaniel of
the Captain's.] He next set out for Carmarthen, and raised a great
deal of money from the Welsh gentry, pretending now to be an
unfortunate sailor belonging to Ireland, who had been cast away
near Portland Race, coming from Bilbao. He proceeded upon the same
story to Aberystwyth and Port Ely, where he chanced to meet with a
brother of the mendicant order, to whom he was well known; they
inquired of each other's success, and many other particulars, and
agreed to join company for some time. Mr. Carew now got a cere-
cloth of pitch, which he laid to his arms, with a raw beef-steak
at the top, covered over with white bread and tar, which has the
exact appearance of a green wound. They still continued in the
same story of being cast away, but, added to it, that he had
fallen off the rigging, and wounded his arm in that manner. They
travelled together with good success as far as Shadwell, where
they parted company.


Chapter XXI
His Journey to Ireland.

Our hero made the best of his way to Holyhead, and begging a
passage on board the packet to Dublin, after a fine trip landed at
Ring's End, near that city. His first inquiry here was for an old
acquaintance, and in particular for one Mr. Crab and Lord
Annesley, who had been schoolfellows with him at Tiverton. He
found my Lord Annesley lived a mile from the town, but did not see
him the first day, being gone to Blessington, as the servants told
him. Accordingly he set out for that town the next day, where he
found my lord at a tavern with several officers; he went in, and
told the tavern-keeper he wanted to speak with his lordship; but,
as his appearance was none of the best, the tavern-keeper did not
like to deliver this message to my lord, but asked what his
business was. Tell him, said he, that I am an old school-fellow of
his, and want to see him. My lord, being told this, came out with
two gentlemen, and inquired who he was; which our hero told him.
Ha! Mr. Carew, said his lordship, is it you, man? walk in, walk
in. What, said one of the captains, is this old Carew? the very
same, replied my lord. After he had sat down for some time, and
talked over several old affairs with my lord, one of the captains
asked him if he could get him a good pointer. Ay, ay, that he can,
replied his lordship; for, by my soul, man, he and I have stolen
many a dog, and lain in many a hay tallet, in our youthful days.
Then turning to Mr. Carew, he told his fame was spread as much in
Ireland as in England. Indeed it is so, replied one of the
captains. His lordship then asked him how he found him out there.
He replied, he had been directed there by their old school-fellow,
Crab. Well, said my lord, you shall go home along with me. He
desired to be excused, as he designed to go and see lord St.
Leger, who was another of his school-fellows; but my lord swore by
his soul he should go home along with him, and visit Lord St.
Leger another time; accordingly a good horse was provided for him,
and they all set out for Dublin.

The next day my Lord Annesley took him to his own house. During
his abode here, which was about a fortnight, our hero received
great civilities from the Irish gentry; Lord Annesley introducing
him to all the chief company in the city, as the man they had
heard so much talk of. One day Mr. O'Brien, a gentleman of great
fortune, being in company, asked Mr. Carew if he had ever been on
board the Yarmouth man-of-war; he replied, that he had been in her
up the Baltic. The gentleman asked if he remembered a young
gentleman about fourteen years of age, very fat, and who had a
livery-servant to wait on him. He replied, that he remembered him
very well, and that he was blest with as beautiful a face as any
youth he ever saw. The gentleman then asked him if he recollected
what became of him; which he answered, by saying he died at
Gosport a day or two after they landed; and that Mr. Price, of
Pool, composed a Latin epitaph for him; at which the gentleman
could not refrain letting fall some tears, it being his own
brother he was speaking of. He then asked what men-of-war were
with them at that time; all which he gave a very good account of,
saying, Sir Charles Wager and Rear-Admiral Walton commanded; Sir
Charles carrying a red flag at the fore-topmast head of the
Torbay, and the latter a blue at the mizen of the Cumberland, both
eighty-gun ships. The gentleman replied, he was satisfied, for he
had given a very faithful account of everything; he then made Mr.
Carew a present to drink his health when he came to England, as
Lord Annesley said he would supply him while he was in Ireland. A
great hunting-match being proposed, Lord Annesley told them that
Mr. Carew could make one with the best of them at the diversion,
upon which he was desired to make one of the party. Accordingly,
they set out very early next morning, and had fine sport, he
exerting all his abilities, though he was afraid of riding into
some bogs, of which the country is full. When the chase was ended,
they all went to Lord Annesley's to dinner, and the company
allowed him to be an excellent sportsman.

Lord Annesley afterwards took him to Newry and many other places,
introducing him to much company. At length he desired liberty to
go and see his old school-fellow, Lord St. Leger, at Doneraile,
which Lord Annesley would not consent to, unless he promised to
call upon him again on his return; which agreeing to do, he sent
his servant with him as far as Blessington. Parting with the
servant here, he travelled to Kilkenny; thence to Cashel, (where
is a fine seat belonging to Lord Mark Ker,) Clonmel, and Cahir,
where our hero was taken dangerously ill. It would be unpardonable
not to mention the hospitality he was treated with here. His good
landlady, finding him so ill, sent for the minister of the place
to come and pray by him, which he accordingly did, and at going
away clapped half-a-crown into his hand, and soon after sent an
apothecary to him, who administered what medicines were proper for
him, which had so good an effect as to enable him to get upon his
legs: however, they would not let him proceed forward for several
days, lest he should relapse; and before he set out, the minister
of the parish sent his clerk round the place to make a collection
for the stranger. At length, being perfectly recovered, he set out
for Lord St. Leger's. When he came there, and was introduced, my
lord presently recollected him, and cried, Why sure, and doubly
sure, it is Carew! He then asked how long he had been in Ireland;
adding, he hoped he would stay with him for some time. His
lordship made him very welcome, and they talked over some of the
merry pranks they had played together. Mr. Carew inquired if Sir
Matthew Day, another of their old schoolfellows, was alive. His
lordship told him he was dead; but that there was a young
gentleman would be glad to see any old friend of his father's. He
abode with Lord St. Leger about a fortnight, being entertained in
the kindest manner possible; at his departure, my lord made him a
handsome present, and gave him a good suit of clothes, with a
recommendatory letter to young Mr. Day.

Here he was received with great civility, as well upon account of
Lord St. Leger's letter, as being an old school-fellow of Mr.
Day's father. The conversation happening to turn upon dogs, Mr.
Day told him he had heard he was very famous for enticing dogs
away, and that Sir William Courtenay's steward had told him there
was not a dog could resist his allurements; however, he believed
he had one that would; he then ordered a surly morose dog to be
brought out, and offered to lay a wager he could not entice him
away, which he readily accepted, and began to whistle to the dog,
but found him very surly; upon which he took out a little bottle,
and dropping a few drops upon a bit of paper, held it unseen to
the dog, and then told Mr. Day the dog would follow him to
England. Away then he went, and the dog after him. Mr. Day and his
servants all followed, calling Roger, Roger, which was the name of
the dog; but Roger turning a deaf ear to all they could say, not
thinking proper to turn about once. Mr. Carew having diverted
himself sufficiently, by leading Mr. Day and his servants above
half-a-mile, turned back again, with the dog still following him.
Having abode here some days, he took his leave, receiving a
handsome present from Mr. Day; he then returned back to Lord
Annesley, and thence to Kinsale, where he took the first
opportunity of a vessel, and landed at Padstow, in Cornwall, after
a short and pleasant passage.


Chapter XXII
He Returns to England and Resumes his Old Ways

From this place he went to Camelford; thence to Great Torrington,
where he met with his wife, and then proceeded to Biddeford: and
on the next day, being Sunday, he strolled down to one Holmes, who
kept a public-house between Biddeford and Appledore, where he
passed great part of the day drinking pretty freely; and money
being at a low ebb with him, he desired landlord Holmes to lend
him a good suit of clothes, which he accordingly did. Being thus
gallantly equipped, he went and planted himself at the church-door
in Biddeford, and pretending to be the supercargo of a vessel
which had been a few days before cast away near the Lizard, he got
a very handsome contribution. From thence he travelled to
Barnstaple, where he had great success, none suspecting him in his
dress, as it was certainly known such a ship had been really cast
away near the Lizard a few days before. Returning back, he called
upon Squire Ackland, at Tremington, where he got half-a-crown of
the lady upon the same story; then, steering to Appledore, he met
with landlord Holmes, who had been in no little fear about his
clothes; however, he would not disrobe till he got to Appledore,
where also he added to his store, and then returning to Holmes, he
restored him his clothes, and gave him some small part of the
profit of the excursion.

It was about this time Mr. Carew became acquainted with the Hon.
Sir William Wyndham in the following manner.—Being at Watchet, in
Somersetshire, near the seat of this gentleman, he was resolved to
pay him a visit; putting on, therefore, a jacket and a pair of
trowsers, he made the best of his way to Orchard Wyndham, Sir
William's seat; and luckily met with him, Lord Bolingbroke, and
several other gentlemen and clergy, with some commanders of
vessels, walking in the park. Mr. Carew approached Sir William
with a great deal of seeming fearfulness and respect; and with
much modesty acquainted him he was a Silverton man, (which parish
chiefly belonged to Sir William,) and that he was the son of one
of his tenants, named Moore; that he had been at Newfoundland, and
in his passage homeward, the vessel was run down by a French ship
in a fog, and only he and two more saved; and, being put on board
an Irish vessel, he was carried into Ireland, and from thence
landed at Watchet. Sir William, hearing this, asked him a great
many questions concerning the inhabitants of Silverton, who were
most of them his own tenants, and of the principal gentlemen in
the neighbourhood, all of whom Mr. Carew was perfectly well
acquainted with, and therefore gave satisfactory answers. Sir
William at last asked him if he knew Bickley, (which is but a
small distance from Silverton,) and if he knew the parson there.
Mr. Carew replied he knew him very well, and indeed so he might,
as it was no other than his own father. Sir William then inquired
what family he had, and whether he had not a son called Bampfylde,
and what was become of him. Your honour, replied he, means the
mumper and dog-stealer: I don't know what has become of him, but
it is a wonder he is not hanged by this time. No, I hope not,
replied Sir William; I should be very glad, for his family's sake,
to see him at my house. Having satisfactorily answered many other
questions, Sir William, generously relieved him with a guinea, and
Lord Bolingbroke followed his example; the other gentlemen and
clergy contributed according to their different ranks, which they
were the more inclined to do, as the captains found he could give
a very exact account of all the settlements, harbours, and most
noted inhabitants of Newfoundland. Sir William then ordered him to
go to his house, and tell the butler to see him well entertained,
which he accordingly did; and he set himself down with great
content and satisfaction; but our enjoyments are often so suddenly
dashed, that it has become a proverb, that many things happen
between the cup and the lip, and Mr. Carew found it so; for, while
he was in the midst of his regale, he saw enter, not the ghost of
bloody Banquo to take his seat from him, nor yet the much more
tremendous figure of Mr. Tom Jones, in a light-coloured coat
covered with streams of blood; no, but the foot-post from
Silverton, with letters to Sir William.—Horace has rightly
observed,

Destrictus ensis cui super impia
cervice pendet, non siculae dapes
dulcem elaborabunt saporem,
non avium citharaeque cantus
somnum reducent:

or, to speak to our English reader, "a man who has a drawn sword
hanging over his head by a hair, has but very little stomach to
eat, however sumptuous the treat." The foot-post, that we just now
mentioned was little less than a very sharp sword hanging by a
hair over Mr. Carew's head, for he thought it natural Sir William
would ask him some questions about Mr. Moore; and as he did not
choose, (though he had passed Sir William's strict examination) to
undergo a fresh one; he made great haste to rise from table, and
set out without using much ceremony. A few miles distant from
hence he met Dr. Poole going from Dulverton to Sir William's, who,
knowing Mr. Carew, stopped his horse to talk to him. Amongst other
conversation at Sir William's, the Dr. happened to mention whom he
had met that day (not knowing that he had been lately there;) it
was soon known by the description he gave of his person and habit,
to be no other than the unfortunate Silverton man, to whom Sir
William and his friends had been so generous, which occasioned a
great deal mirth.

About two months after, Mr. Carew again ventured to pay his honour
a second visit, in the habit and character of an unfortunate
grazier; he met the worthy baronet and his lady taking the air in
a chaise, in a meadow where some haymakers were then at work; he
approached them with a great deal of modest simplicity, and began
a very moving tale of the misfortunes he had met with in life. In
the midst of his oration, Sir William called to the haymakers to
secure him; which struck his eloquence dumb, or at least changed
it from the pathetic to the tragic style, for he could not
conceive what might be the end of this; however, the baronet soon
gave him a choice of either a true confession of his name and
profession, or a commitment to prison; he made choice of the
former, and confessed himself to be Bampfylde-Moore Carew,
sovereign of the whole community of mendicants. Sir William, with
a great deal of good-nature, treated him with all that respect
which is due to royalty; entertained him generously at his house,
and made him a very handsome present at his departure, desiring
him to call upon him as he came that way; and he was ever a
constant friend and benefactor to him.


Chapter XXIII
He Bilks the Customs' Men

Soon after this he planned a new design, which he put into
execution with great success. Dressing himself up in a chequered
shirt, jacket, and trowsers, he went upon Exeter quay, and, with
the rough but artless air and behaviour of a sailor, inquired for
some of the king's officers, whom he informed that he belonged to
a vessel lately come from France, which had landed a large
quantity of run goods, but the captain was a rascal, and had used
him ill, and damn his blood if he would not—. He was about to
proceed, but the officers, who with greedy ears swallowed all he
said, interrupted him by taking him into the custom-house, and
filling him a bumper of cherry brandy, which when he had drunk,
they forced another upon him, persuading him to wet the other eye,
rightly judging that the old proverb, In wine there is truth,
might with equal propriety be applied to brandy, and that they
should have the fuller discovery, the more the honest sailor's
heart was cheered; but, that no provocation should be wanting to
engage him to speak the truth, they asked him if he wanted any
money. He with much art answered very indifferently, no; adding,
he scorned to make such a discovery out of a mercenary view, but
that he was resolved to be revenged of his captain. They then
ordered him to the sign of the Boot, in St. Thomas's, Exeter,
whither they soon followed him, having first sent to Mr. Eastwood,
an exciseman, to ask what he would have for dinner, and what
liquor he would have to drink. A fire was lighted upstairs in a
private room, a couple of ducks roasted, and full glasses of wine
and punch went cheerfully round; they then thrust four guineas
into his hand, which at first he seemed unwilling to accept of,
which made them the more pressing. He now began to open his mind
with great freedom, gave a particular account of the vessel, where
they had taken in their cargo at France, and what it consisted of;
the day they sailed, and the time they were on their passage; and
at last concluded with acquainting them they had landed and
concealed part of their valuable cargo in the out-houses of Squire
Mallock, of Cockington, and the remainder in those of Squire Cary,
of Tor-abbey, both which houses, upon account of their situation
on the sea-side, were very noted for such concealments. The
officers, having now got on the scent, were like sagacious hounds
for pursuing it forthwith, and also thought proper the sailor
should accompany them; and, to prevent all suspicion, resolved he
should now change his habit; they therefore dressed him in a
ruffled shirt, a fine suit of broad cloth belonging to the
collector, and put a gold-laced hat on his head; then, mounting
him on a fine black mare, away they rode together, being in all
seven or eight of them; they that night reached Newton-Bushel, and
slept at the Bull; nothing was wanting to make the night jovial;
the greatest delicacies the town afforded were served up at their
table, the best liquors were broached for them, and music, with
its enlivening charms, crowned the banquet; the officers' hearts
were quite open and cheerful, as they already enjoyed, in
imagination, all the booty they were to seize on the morrow.
Thinking they could not do enough for the honest sailor, they
inquired if he knew anything of accounts; promising, if he did, to
get him a place in the customs. In the morning, after a good
hearty breakfast, they set forward for Tor-abbey; and, being
arrived in Tor-town, they demanded the constables' assistance, who
was with the utmost reluctance prevailed on to accompany them in
making this search; Squire Gary being a gentleman so universally
beloved by the whole parish, (to which he always behaved as a
father,) that everyone was very backward in doing anything to give
him the least uneasiness. Did gentlemen of large estates in the
country but once taste the exalted pleasure of making the whole
neighbourhood happy, and consider how much honest industry they
might support, how much misery they might alleviate, and how many
daily blessings they might have poured forth upon their heads from
hearts overflowing with love, respect and gratitude, almost to
adoration, we should not so often see them leave their noble
country mansions to repair to noise and folly; nor exchange the
heart-enlivening pleasure of making numbers happy, for the
beguiling smiles and unmeaning professions of a prime minister.

Being come to the house, they all dismounted, and the collector
desired the sailor to hold his horse, but he replied he would
rather go round the garden, and meet them on the other side of the
house, to prevent anything from being conveyed away, and that it
would be proper he should be present to show the particular place 
where everything was deposited. This appeared quite right to the
collector; he therefore contented himself with fastening his horse
to the garden rails, and proceeded with the rest of the officers,
in great form, to search the dog-kennel, coal-house, dove-house,
stables, and all other suspicious places, expecting every minute
to see the informing sailor, who by this time had nearly got back
to Newton-Bushel, having turned his horse's head that way as soon
as he was out of sight of the collector. He stopped at the Bull,
where they had been the preceding night, and drank a bottle of
wine; then, ordering a handsome dinner to be got ready for his
company, whom he said he had left behind, because his business
called him with urgent haste to Exeter, he clapped his spurs to
his horse, and did not stop till he reached that city, where he
put up at the Oxford inn, then kept by Mr. Buckstone, to whom both
himself and friends were well known; he acquainted Mr. Buckstone
that he was now reformed, and lived at home with his friends, and
spent the night very jovially, calling for the best of everything.
In the morning he desired Mr. Buckstone to do him the favour of
lending him a couple of guineas, till he could receive some of a
merchant in the city upon whom he had a bill, for the merchant was
gone out of town. As Mr. Buckstone had a mare in his custody worth
ten or twelve pounds, he made no scruple of doing it; and soon
after Mr. Carew thought proper to change his quarters, without
bidding the landlord good-bye. Leaving the mare to discharge the
reckoning and the loan he had borrowed, he repaired immediately to
a house of usual resort for his community, where he pulls off the
fine clothes the collector had lent him, and rigged himself again
in a jacket and trowsers; then setting out for Topsham, about
three miles from the city of Exeter, he there executed the same
stratagem upon Mr. Carter and the other officers there; informing
them also of some great concealments at Sir Coppleston Bampfylde's
house, at Poltimore, for which they rewarded him with a good treat
and a couple of guineas.

The Exeter officers (whom, as we have before said, he left without
the least ceremony at Squire Gary's) having searched all the out-
houses, and even in the dwelling-house, very narrowly, without
finding any prohibited goods, began to suspect the sailor had
outwitted them; therefore they returned in a great hurry to
Newton-Bushel, all their mirth being turned into vexation, and
their great expectations vanished into smoke. Soon after they had
dismounted from their horses, the landlord brought in the dinner,
which he said their companion had ordered to be got ready for
them; but though it was a very elegant one, yet they found
abundance of faults with everything; however, as it was too late
to reach Exeter that night, they were obliged to take up their
quarters there; but, instead of the jollity and good humour that
reigned among them the night before, there now succeeded a sullen
silence, interrupted now and then by some exclamations of revenge,
and expressions of dislike of everything that was brought them:
when they came into Exeter the next day, they had intelligence
brought them of the mare, which was safe enough at the Oxford inn;
but they were obliged to disburse the money Mr. Carew had made her
surety for.

From Topsham Mr. Carew proceeded to Exmouth, where he also
succeeded, and from thence to Squire Stucky's, a justice of peace
at Brandscombe, about four miles from Sidmouth; and, being
introduced, acquainted his worship with several discoveries he
could make; the justice thereupon immediately dispatched a
messenger for Mr. Duke, an officer in Sidmouth; in the meantime he
entertained him very handsomely, and pressed him to accept of two
guineas, as a small token of kindness, often shaking him by the
hand, and saying, he thought himself very much obliged to him for
making this discovery: and that, as a reward for his loyalty to
the king, he would engage to get him a place, having many friends
at London. About two o'clock the next morning, Mr. Duke, the
sailor, and servant of the squire's, set forward towards Honiton,
it being at Squire Blagdon's, near the town, where they were to
find the hidden treasure. Mr. Carew was mounted on a good horse of
Justice Stucky's, and, while the officer and servant were very
busy in searching the out-houses and stables, Mr. Carew gave them
the slip, and posted away to Honiton, and took some refreshment at
the Three Lions; then leaving the justice's horse to answer for
it, hasted away to Lyme in Dorsetshire; where he applied to Mr.
Jordan, the collector of the place, whom he sent upon the same
errand some miles off, to Colonel Brown's, at Frampton; but the
collector, not judging it proper for him to accompany him, for
fear of creating suspicion, left him at his own house till his
return, giving his servant orders to let him want for nothing; at
the same time making him a handsome present, as an earnest of a
greater reward when he returned. Mr. Carew enjoyed himself very
contentedly at the collector's house for several hours, both
eating and drinking of the best, as he knew Frampton was at too
great a distance for him to return presently; but he prudently
weighed his anchor when he thought the collector might be on his
return, and steered his course towards Weymouth, where he made his
application to the collector, and after being handsomely treated,
and a present given to him, sent the officers to Squire Groves's,
near White-street, and Squire Barber's, on the Chase, both in
Wiltshire. And as soon as they were gone, he set out for Poole;
and sent the collector and officers of that place to Sir Edward
Boobey's, who lived in the road between Salisbury and Hendon; they
gave him two guineas in hand, and a promise of more upon their
return with the booty; in the meantime they recommended him to an
inn, and gave orders that he should have anything the house
afforded, and they would make satisfaction for it; but this
adventure had like not to have ended so well for him as the
former; for, being laid down upon a bed to nap, having drunk too
freely, he heard some people drinking and talking in the next room
of the great confusion there was in all the sea-ports in the west
of England, occasioned by a trick put on the king's officers by
one Bampfylde Carew, and that this news was brought to Poole by a
Devonshire gentleman, who accidently came that way. Mr. Carew
hearing this, rightly judged Poole was no proper place to make a
longer stay in; he therefore instantly arose, and, by the help of
a back door, got into a garden, and with much difficulty climbed
over the wall belonging thereto, and made the best of his way to
Christchurch, in Hampshire; here he assumed the character of a
shipwrecked seaman, and raised considerable contributions.

Coming to Ringwood, he inquired of the health of Sir Thomas
Hobbes, a gentleman in that neighbourhood, who was a person of
great hospitality; he was told that some of the mendicant order,
having abused his benevolence, in taking away a pair of boots,
after he had received a handsome present from him, it had so far
prejudiced Sir Thomas, that he did not exercise the same
hospitality as formerly. This greatly surprised and concerned Mr.
Carew, that any of his subjects should be guilty of so ungrateful
an action: he was resolved therefore to inquire strictly into it,
that, if he could find out the offender, he might inflict a
deserved punishment upon him; and therefore resolved to pay a
visit to Sir Thomas the next morning, hoping he should get some
light into the affair. When he came to the house, it was pretty
early in the day, and Sir Thomas had not come out of his chamber;
however, he sent up his pass, as a shipwrecked seaman, by one of
the servants, who presently returned with half-a-crown. As he had
been always wont to receive a large present from Sir Thomas,
whenever he had applied to him, he thought there was some unfair
practice at the bottom; he therefore asked the footman for a
copper of ale to drink the family's health, hoping Sir Thomas
might come down by that time; the servant pretended to be in so
great a hurry, that he could not attend to draw any, but he was of
too humane a nature to permit the poor sailor to suffer by his
hurry, so gave him a shilling out of his own pocket to drink at
the next public-house. This extraordinary generosity of the
footman increased Mr. Carew's suspicion; he therefore kept
loitering about the door, and often looking up at the window, in
hopes of seeing Sir Thomas, which accordingly happened, for at
length he flung up the sash, and accosted him in a free familiar
manner, called him Brother Tar, and told him he was very sorry for
his misfortunes, and that he had sent him a piece of money to
assist him in his journey towards Bristol. Heaven bless your
honour, replied he, for the half-crown your honour sent me; upon
which Sir Thomas ran down in his morning gown, and with great
passion seized the footman by the throat, and asked him what he
had given the sailor. The fellow was struck dumb with this, and
indeed there was no need for his tongue on the present occasion,
as his looks, and the trembling of his limbs, sufficiently
declared his guilt; however he at last owned it with his tongue;
and excused himself by saying, he knew there was an ill use made
of the large bounties his honour gave. Sir Thomas, enraged at the
insolence of his servant, bestowed upon him the discipline of the
horse-whip, for his great care and integrity in not seeing his
bounty abused; adding, he now saw by whose villany he had lost his
boots. He then made the footman return the whole guinea to the
sailor, and discharged him from any further service in his family;
upon which Mr. Carew took his leave with great thankfulness, and
went his way, highly pleased with his good success in this
adventure.—Here we cannot forbear wishing that there was no higher
character in life than Sir Thomas's footman, to whose hands gold
is apt to cling in passing through them; that there was no steward
who kept back part of his master's rent, because he thinks he has
more than he knows what to do with; no managers of charities, who
retain part of the donors' benefactions in their own hands,
because it is too much for the poor; nor officers of the public,
who think they may squander the public treasure without account,
because what is everybody's is nobody's.

Mr. Carew having laid aside his sailor's habit, put on a long
loose vest, placed a turban on his head, dignified his chin with a
venerable long beard, and was now no other than a poor unfortunate
Grecian, whose misfortunes had overtaken him in a strange country.
He could not utter his sorrowful tale, being unacquainted with the
language of the country; but his mute silence, his dejected
countenance, a sudden tear that now and then flowed down his
cheek, accompanied with a noble air of distress, all pleaded for
him in more persuasive eloquence than perhaps the softest language
could have done, and raised him considerable gains; and indeed
benevolence can never be better exerted than towards unfortunate
strangers, for no distress can be so forlorn as that of a man in
necessity in a foreign country; he has no friends to apply to, no
laws to shelter him under, no means to provide for his
subsistence, and therefore can have no resource but in those
benevolent minds who look upon the whole world as their own
brethren.


Chapter XXIV
His Voyage to the Baltic

We have already mentioned Mr. Carew's being on board the Yarmouth
man-of-war up the Baltic; it will not, therefore, be improper here
to relate the occasion of that voyage, which was as follows:—He
and his friend, Coleman, being at Plymouth, and appearing to be
able-bodied men, some officers seeing them there, thought them
extremely fit to serve his majesty, therefore obliged them to go
on board the Dunkirk man-of-war: but they not liking this, Coleman
pricked himself upon the wrists, between his fingers, and other
joints, and inflamed it so with gunpowder, that every one thought
it to be the itch; he was therefore carried ashore, and put into
the hospital, from whence he soon made his escape. Mr. Carew tried
the stratagem, but too late; for the Lively and Success men-of-war
now arriving from Ireland with impressed men, they were all of
them carried immediately (together with the impressed men lying at
Plymouth) to the grand fleet, then lying at Spithead; they were
first put on board the Bredau, Admiral Hosier, to choose whom he
liked of them: and their names being called over, the Irishmen
were all refused; which Mr. Carew seeing declared himself, in a
true Irish brogue, to be a poor Irish weaver, and disabled in one
arm, whereupon he was also refused: the Irish, among whom he was
now ranked, were carried from ship to ship, and none would accept
of them, which made them all expect to be discharged; but they
were disappointed in their hopes, for they were put on board the
Yarmouth, Captain O'Brien, being one of the squadron destined for
the Baltic. Mr. Carew finding Captain O'Brien refused no Irishmen,
when he came to be examined changed his note, and declared himself
to be an Englishman, but crippled in one arm: however, the captain
accepted of him, and putting a sword in his hand, made him stand
sentry at the bitts, which easy post he liked very well; and
during all the time he was on board, every one supposed him really
disabled in his arm.

The fleet, sailing from Spithead with a fair wind, anchored safely
at Copenhagen, and then the king of Denmark came on board Sir
Charles Wager: the moment he set his foot on board, both the flag-
ships were covered with an infinite number of colours of every
hue, which, waving in the wind, made a most gallant sight: upon
his departure, the colours were all taken down in an instant, and
every ship fired eighteen or twenty guns. Sailing from Copenhagen,
they anchored next in Elson Cape, in Sweden; from hence they
sailed to Reval, in a line of battle, in form of a rainbow, and
anchored there: the sick men were carried ashore to Aragan island,
which Mr. Carew observing, and burning with love to revisit his
native country, counterfeited sickness, and was accordingly
carried ashore to this island, which lies near Reval, belonging to
the Muscovites, from whence boats came every day to fetch wood. He
prevailed upon an Englishman, who was a boatswain to one of the
Czarina's men-of-war, to give him a passage in his boat from that
island to Reval town; when he came there, the boatswain used great
endeavours to persuade him to enter her majesty's service, but it
was all in vain, being resolved to return to his beloved country;
the boatswain, therefore, having entertained him a day and a night
at his house, gave him, at his departure, a piece of money, and
engaged several Englishmen of his acquaintance to do the same; he
likewise furnished him with a bag of provisions, a bottle of
excellent brandy, a tinder-box, and a few lines wrote in that
country language, which he was to show to those he met, to inform
him of the road he was to go; and then conducted him out of the
town. That night he took up his lodgings in the woods, and, by the
help of his tinder-box, made a large fire all round him, to secure
himself from any visits from the wild beasts, then broiled a piece
of flesh, drank a dram, and rested very quietly till morning, it
being the middle of summer.

The whole country here is wild, full of large woods and
uninhabited deserts, the towns and villages lying very thin. In
the morning, finding his way out of the woods, he espied a lonely
hut, to which he made up, and making signs of hunger and thirst,
they gave him some rusk bread and cabereta, or goat's flesh, to
eat, and some goat's milk to drink, which is the usual fare
amongst those people, who are most of them Lutherans by religion,
and lead very sober lives; of some of them he got small bits of
money, which they call campekes, and are of silver, something
larger than a barley-corn, being of a penny value; he likewise
frequently got drams of excellent brandy amongst them, and his
shoes being worn-out by travelling, they gave him a pair of good
wooden ones, which sat very awkwardly on his English feet.

After six or seven days' travel through this wild country he came
to Riga, a large town and famous sea-port: here he met with many
English merchants and commanders of vessels, who were very kind to
him; he tarried two days in Riga, to rest and refresh himself:
during which the English merchants and commanders provided
lodgings and other accommodations for him, collecting upwards of
fifty shillings for him. Having expressed his utmost gratitude
towards his good benefactors, he again pursued his journey,
subsisting himself sometimes on the charity of the inhabitants of
the country, and at other times milking the cows upon the
mountains or in the woods. The next place of note he arrived at
was the city of Danzig, in the kingdom of Poland: here he found a
great number of English merchants who traded to Exeter, and
Bristol, and had many correspondents living in those places,
several of whom Mr. Carew being acquainted with, he gave a
particular account of.

Having been entertained here very hospitably for several days, he
set out again, having first received some handsome presents from
the English merchants. From Danzig he got a passage on board an
English brigantine bound for Copenhagen, but through stress of
weather was obliged to put into Elson Cape, where he went on
shore, and travelled by land to Stockholm, the capital of Sweden,
but in his road thither he lost his way in this wild and desert
country, and for the space of three days and nights saw neither
house, hut, nor human creature, the weather being very thick and
foggy. Nothing could be more melancholy and dreadful than these
three days' travel; his provisions were exhausted, and every step
he took he was uncertain whether it might lead him farther into
the woods, as he could make no observation how the country lay,
the fog intercepting the light of everything. Sometimes fancy
would paint to him a hut through the fog at a little distance, to
which he would direct his steps with eager haste, but when he came
nearer, found it nothing but an illusion of sight, which almost
drove him to despair. The fourth day he was exceedingly hungry,
when, to his great joy, he espied two she-goats fastened together
with ropes of straw: he ran to them with great eagerness, and
drunk very heartily of their milk; after this he began to consider
that there must be some hut at least hard by, as the goats could
not have strayed in that manner any great distance; he therefore
resolved to stay upon the spot for some time; and soon after the
fog clearing up, he espied a hut just before him, to which he
directly repaired, and there got a belly-full of their homely
fare, and directions to find his way to Stockholm.

The religion of this country being chiefly Lutheran, he passed for
the son of a Presbyterian parson, and his name Slowly, pretending
to have been cast away in a vessel bound for Revel. The Lutherans
at Stockholm were exceedingly kind to him and raised a handsome
contribution for him. He likewise chanced there to meet with a
relation of Dr. Bredaw, a Swiss gentleman, that resided at
Dartmouth, in Devonshire, who asked several questions about him;
and as Mr. Carew was well acquainted with him, he gave very
satisfactory answers, upon which account that gentleman gave him a
guinea, a great fur cap, a coat, and a fine dog, with a letter to
carry to his relation at Dartmouth.

From Stockholm he went to Charles-town, and after a short stay
there continued his journey to Copenhagen, the metropolis of
Denmark; here he met with one Captain Thomas Giles, of Minehead in
Somersetshire, who knew him, and was surprised to see him in that
part of the world, and not only liberally relieved him himself,
but recommended him to several English commanders there, and also
to several inhabitants of the city. From Copenhagen he went to
Elsinburg, thence to Elsinore, where he got a passage for England,
and once more arrived in his native country.

Chapter XXV
His Benevolence towards an Unfortunate Child; He
Travels to France and Meets the Charitable Mrs.
Horner

Landing at Newcastle-upon-Tyne, he visited his wife's relations,
and then set forward for Devonshire, travelling all the way in the
character of a shipwrecked seaman. Meeting at Exeter with his
beloved wife, and likewise with his friend Coleman and his wife,
they travelled together for some time, during which Coleman's wife
was delivered of a daughter; but as they found so helpless an
infant a great hindrance to their travelling, Mr. Carew contrived
a stratagem to get rid of it, and at the same time advanced the
fortune of the child.

There was in the town, where they then were, a gay bachelor, who
lived with his mother and sisters, and was a great admirer of that
order of female travellers called Cousin Betties. Coleman's wife
had been with him some months before in that character, was very
well entertained, and, amongst other favours, received a present
of a silk handkerchief. They therefore dressed up the babe very
neatly, wrapped it up exceeding warm, and put it in a hand-basket,
taking care to put in the handkerchief Coleman's wife had received
from this gay bachelor; then getting a large boar cat, in the dusk
of the evening they tied it to the knocker of the door, setting
down before it the basket with the helpless infant. The cat, not
liking the treatment, made a hideous squalling, and with his
struggling, rap, rap, rap, went the knocker of the door; out ran
the gentleman, with his mother, sisters, and servants, and the
neighbourhood gathered about the door to see what this noise could
mean. Mr. Carew and Coleman mingled among them to learn what would
be the event of their stratagem. The cat, by long struggling, got
free of the knocker, and ran away, only leaving part of the tail
behind. The basket alone now engaged the attention of every one,
and being delivered to the gentleman to open, the feeble cries of
an infant soon reached their ears. The mother and sisters, alarmed
at this unexpected salutation, snatched the basket from him, and
upon the child's breast found a note in these words:

"Remember, sir, where you last met me, you have not been so kind as
you often promised and swore you would: however, it justly belongs
to you. I have made bold to send you the fruits of our meeting, and
this handkerchief which you made me as a token. Be kind to our
infant daughter; and the unfortunate mother on her part, will
forgive you.
	"Yours, &c."

The horrid squalling of the cat did not grate so disagreeably upon
the gentleman's ears, as the reading of these words; so that his
hat and wig were flung off, and he ran about stamping and swearing
that the child was none of his, neither did he know anything of
the mother. On the other hand, his mother and sisters flew into a
violent rage, assailing his ears on every side with reproaches; so
that he would at that time have thought deafness preferable to
anyone of the senses. "Dost thou deny the child to be thine?"
cried the mother: "has it not thy very eyes, nose, and mouth? and
is this not thy very handkerchief? this thou canst not deny, for I
can safely swear it was thine." The poor gentleman, thus beset on
all sides, was obliged to quit the field; the child was taken into
the house, and brought up and educated there, and is at this day a
very accomplished fine lady.

Some time after this adventure, Mr. Carew took passage at
Folkstone, in Kent, for Boulogne in France, where he arrived safe,
and proceeded to Paris and other cities in that kingdom. His habit
was now tolerably good, his countenance grave, his behaviour sober
and decent, pretending to be a Roman-catholic, who left England,
his native country, out of an ardent zeal of spending his days in
the bosom of the catholic church. This story readily gained
belief; his zeal was universally applauded, and handsome
contributions made for him; but at the same time he was so zealous
a Roman-catholic, with a little change of habit, he used to
address those English he heard of in any place as a protestant
shipwrecked seaman. He had the good fortune, in this character, to
meet an English physician at Paris, to whom he told his deplorable
tale, who was so much affected by it, that he not only relieved
him very handsomely, but, what was more, recommended him to that
noble pattern of unexhausted benevolence, Mrs. Horner, who was on
her travels, from whom he received ten guineas, and from some
other company with her, five more.

Here, reader, if thou hast a good heart, we cannot entertain thee
better, than by drawing a true though faint picture of this
generous lady; for, were benevolence and generosity real beings,
we are persuaded they would act just like her; with such an
unsparing hand would they bestow their bounties, and with such
magnificence reward desert; with such godlike compassion cheer the
afflicted, and just so make happy all around them: but thou canst
form no adequate idea, unless thou hast been in the neighbourhood
of that noble mansion, [Note: the seat of Mrs. Horner, at
Mulberry, Dorsetshire] where benevolence has fixed her seat.
Permit me, therefore, to transport thee thither, to bless thy
sight with the delightful scene. See, already an eat and decent
temple [Note: the parish church, rebuilt at her expense] strikes
the eye; it is she that has erected it to the honour of her God.
Thou art surprised, I see, to behold the grave doctor [Note: an
eminent physician, who is allowed a constant salary by her to
visit the poor sick in her neighbourhood] coming out of his
chariot to enter the wretched huts of poverty; but know, she has
already paid his fees: see here another compounding the choicest
drugs and medicines for a whole neighbourhood; it is her bounty
that has supplied them. Cast your eye the other way, and behold
that company of aged and decrepit poor; they are going to receive
their daily bread at her table. But let us enter the poor cottage;
see, here are the holy Scriptures and other books of pious
instruction; and, hark! the lisping child is reading distinctly in
one of them; her munificence has bestowed these useful gifts, and
instilled instruction into that tender mind. Behold, with how
dejected a look and grief-swollen heart, with what a load of care,
yon person enters the mansion: but see, he returns—how changed his
aspect! joy sparkles in his eye, and thankfulness swells his
exulting heart; content sits cheerful upon his brow, and he no
longer bends under his care: what wonderful magic has wrought this
sudden change?—the opening only of her beneficent hand has done
it.


Chapter XXVI
He is Seized and Transported again

What we are now going to relate will raise an honest indignation
in the breast of every true lover of liberty; for all such know
that the beauteous flower of liberty sickens to the very root
(like the sensitive plant) at the lightest touch of the iron hand
of power upon anyone of its most distant branches.

Mr. Carew being in the city of Exeter with his wife, and, having
visited his old friends there, he walked to Topsham, about three
miles distant, leaving his wife in Exeter. Alas! little did he
think this walk would end in a long and cruel separation from his
friends and country; little did he imagine, that, in the land of
freedom and justice, he should be seized upon by the cruel grasp
of lawless power: though poor, he thought himself under the
protection of the laws, and, as such, liable to no punishment till
they inflicted it. How far he thought right in this, let the
sequel tell. Going down to Topsham, and walking upon the quay
there, enjoying the beauties of a fine evening, meditating no
harm, and suspecting no danger, he was accosted by merchant D—y,
accompanied with several captains of vessels, in some such words
as these: Ha! Mr. Carew, you are come in a right time! As you came
home for your own pleasure you shall go over for mine. They then
laid hands on him, who found it in vain to resist, as he was
overpowered by numbers; he therefore desired to be carried before
some magistrate, but this was not hearkened to, for they forced
him on board a boat, without the presence or authority of any
officer of justice, not so much as suffering him to take leave of
his wife, or acquaint her with his misfortune, though he begged
the favour almost with tears. The boat carried him on board the
Phillory, Captain Simmonds, bound for America with convicts, which
then lay at Powderham-castle waiting for a fair wind. Here, had my
pen gall enough, I would put a blot of eternal infamy on that
citizen of liberty, who usurped so much power over a fellow-
citizen, and those who suffered a brother of liberty, however
undeserving, to be dragged to slavery by the lawless hand of
power, without the mandate of sovereign justice. Foolish wretch!
dost thou not know that thou oughtest to be more careful of
keeping all usurping power within its bounds, than thou wouldst
the raging sea ready to overflow and overwhelm them all; for thou
who hast consented to see power oppress a fellow-heir of glorious
liberty, how canst thou complain, if its all-grasping iron hand
should seize upon thyself, or whatever thou holdest most dear?
then wouldst thou, too late, bewail that thou hadst ever suffered
power wantonly to set foot on the neck of liberty.

But to return: Mr. Carew was no sooner put on board, than he was
strictly searched, and then taken between decks, where he was
ironed down with the convicts. There was at the same time a
violent fever raging among them, and Mr. Carew, by being chained
with them night and day, was soon infected, and taken very ill;
however, he had not the liberty of sending to his wife, nor any of
his friends, though they lay three weeks in the roads for a fair
wind. In the meantime, his wife, not hearing anything from him,
and uncertain what was become of him, or whether he was alive or
dead, abandoned herself to an excess of grief, for he had always
been a kind and affectionate husband to her; she therefore sought
him up and down, at all the houses of his usual resort, but in
vain, for no news could she gain of her beloved husband.

The wind coming fair, they hoisted sail, and soon bid adieu to the
English coasts. We need not describe what passed in Mr. Carew's
breast at this time; anger and grief prevailed by turns, sometimes
resentment, for being thus treated, fired his bosom, and he vowed
revenge: at other times the thoughts of his being thus
unexpectedly separated from his country and friends, and doomed to
an ignominious slavery, filled him with sad and melancholy
reflections; however, he had the pleasure, before it was long, of
knowing he was not entirely deserted; for Captain Simmonds, the
commander of the Phillory, a humane compassionate man, came down
to him between decks, soon after they were under sail, and bid him
be of good cheer, for he should want for nothing; and though he
had strict orders from merchant D—y never to let him return, yet
he would be a friend to him, and provide for him in the best
manner he could. Mr. Carew returned thanks to his generous and
unexpected benefactor in as handsome a manner as he was able.

Soon after this, he had liberty allowed him of coming upon deck,
where the captain entered into conversation with him, and jocosely
asked if he thought he could be at home before him. He generously
replied he thought he could, at least he would endeavour to be so;
which the captain took all in good part.

Thus did Mr. Carew spend his time, in as agreeable a manner as
could be expected under his present circumstances: but, alas! all
our happiness is too fleeting, and we scarcely taste the pleasure
before it is ravished from us: and thus it happened to our hero;
for they had scarcely been under sail five weeks before the good
Captain Simmonds was taken ill, which increased every day with too
many fatal symptoms; till at last death, who regards alike the
good and virtuous, and the bad and vicious, struck the fatal blow:
but the approaches of the grisly tyrant were not so dreadful to
this man, as the distress it would occasion to his wife and
family, whom he cried out for during his whole illness. Mr. Carew
bewailed the loss of this generous benefactor with more than
outward sorrow. Everything in the vessel was now in confusion by
the death of the captain; at length the mate, one Harrison of
Newcastle, took charge of the vessel and the captain's effects;
but had not enjoyed his new honours before he was taken
dangerously ill, so that the vessel was obliged to be left to the
care of the common sailors, and was several times in great danger
of being lost. At last, after sixteen weeks passage, in the grey
of the morning, they made Cape Charles, and then bore away to Cape
Henry: at Hampton they took in a pilot. The vessel having several
times run upon the sand, and was not got off again without great
difficulty; the pilot soon after brought them to Kent Island,
where they fired a gun, and Harrison, who was now recovered, went
on shore, near Annapolis, and made a bargain with one Mr. Delany
of that place, for Mr. Carew, as an expert gardener. He was then
sent on shore, and Mr. Delany asked him if he understood
gardening. Being willing to get out of Harrison's hands, he
replied in the affirmative; but Mr. Delany asking him if he could
mow, he replied in the negative. Then you are no gardener, replied
Mr. Delany, and so refused to buy him. Then one Hilldrop, who had
been transported about three years before from Exeter, for horse
stealing, and had married a currier's widow in Annapolis, had a
mind to purchase him, but they could not agree about the price,
whereupon he was put on board again, and they sailed from Miles-
river.

Here they fired a gun, and the captain went on shore; in the
meantime the men prisoners were ordered to be close shaved, and
the women to have clean caps on: this was scarcely done, before an
overseer belonging to Mr. Bennet, in Way-river, and several
planters, came up to buy. The prisoners were all ordered upon
deck, and Mr. Carew among them: some of the planters knew him
again, and cried out, "Is not this the man Captain Froade brought
over, and put a pot-hook upon?" Yes, replies Mr. Harrison, the
very same: at which they were much surprised, having an account he
had been either killed by the wild beasts or drowned in some
river. Ay, ay, replied Harrison with a great oath, I'll take care
he shall not be at home before me. By this time several of the
prisoners were sold, the bowl went merrily round, and many of the
planters gave Mr. Carew a glass, but none of them chose to buy
him.

During this, Mr. Carew, observing a great many canoes and small
boats lying along-side the vessel, thought it not impossible to
make himself master of one them, and by that means reach the
shore, where he supposed he might conceal himself till he found an
opportunity of getting off; though this was a very hazardous
attempt, and, if unsuccessful, would expose him to a great deal of
hard usage, and probably put it out of his power of ever regaining
his liberty, yet he was resolved to venture. He now recollected
the common maxim, that fortune favours the bold: and therefore
took an opportunity, just as it grew dark, of slipping nimbly down
the ship's side into one of the canoes, which he paddled with as
much silence and expedition as possible towards the shore: but he
had not gone far before the noise he made gave the alarm, that one
of the prisoners had escaped. Harrison immediately called out to
inquire which of them, and where Carew was; and, being told that
he was gone off, swore that he would much rather have lost half of
the prisoners than him.

All hands were then called upon to pursue; the captain and
planters left their bowl; the river was soon covered with canoes,
and everything was in confusion. Mr. Carew was within hearing of
this, but, by plying his canoe well, had the good fortune to get
on shore before any of them; he immediately took himself to the
woods as soon as he landed, and climbed up into a great tree,
where he had not been many minutes before he heard the captain,
sailors, and planters, all in pursuit of him; the captain fretted
and stormed, the sailors d—d their blood, and the planters
endeavoured to pacify everything, by telling the captain not to
fear his getting off. He heard all this, though not unmoved, yet
without taking notice of it: at last, finding their search
fruitless, the captain, sailors, and planters returned; the
planters still assuring the captain they would have him in the
morning.

As soon as they were gone he began to reflect upon his present
situation, which, indeed, was melancholy enough, for he had no
provisions, was beset on every side, quite incapable of judging
what to undertake, or what course to steer: however, he at last
resolved to steer farther into the woods, which he accordingly
did, and got up into another tree: here he sat all the succeeding
day, without a morsel of food; but was diverted with a great
multitude of squirrels he saw skipping from tree to tree; and had
he had a gun, he could have shot hundreds of pigeons, there was so
great a plenty of them. The next day, towards night, hunger became
too powerful, and he was almost spent for want of food; in this
necessity he knew not what to do; at last, happening to spy a
planter's house at a distance, he was resolved to venture down in
the night, thinking he might chance to find food of some sort or
other, in or about the house: agreeable to this resolution, he
came down the tree in the middle of the night, and, going into the
planter's yard, to his great joy he found there a parcel of milk
cows penned in, which he soon milked in the crown of his hat,
making a most delicious feast, and then retired to the woods
again, climbing up into a tree, where he passed the day much more
easy than he had the preceding one.

Having found out this method of subsisting, he proceeded forwards
in the same manner, concealing himself in a tree in the day-time,
and travelling all the night, milking the cows as often as he had
an opportunity; and steering his course as near as he could guess
towards Duck's Creek.

On the fifth night he heard the voices of several people near him
in the woods, upon which he stepped on one side, and concealed
himself behind a tree, till they had passed by. When he came near
enough to distinguish their words, he heard them say, we will make
the best of our way to Duck's Creek, and there we shall certainly
have him. He now judged that these were some men in pursuit of
him, therefore thought himself very happy in having so narrowly
escaped them.

On the eighth day, being upon a tree, he discovered a lone house,
near the skirts of the woods, and saw all the family (as he
supposed) going out to hoe tobacco, and the dog following them;
this was a joyful sight to him, for he had not, the two preceding
nights, met with any cows, and consequently had been without food.
As soon, therefore, as the family were out of sight, he came down
from the tree, and ventured in the house, where he found not only
enough to satisfy his hunger, but what might be deemed luxury in
his present condition: for there was a jolly cake, powell, a sort
of Indian corn bread, and good omani, which is kidney-beans ground
with Indian corn, sifted, then put into a pot to boil, and eat
with molasses. Seeing so many dainties, he did not hesitate long,
but, hunger pressing, sat down and ate the omani with as much
composure as if he had been invited thereto by the owner of it:
and knowing that hunger and necessity are bound by no laws of
honour, he took the liberty of borrowing the jolly cake, powell,
and a leg of fine pork, then hastened back to the tree with his
booty. What the people thought when they returned at night with
good appetites, and found their dainty omani, their jolly cake,
and their pork, all vanished, we know not, but suppose they were
not a little surprised.

Being thus stocked with provisions, he made the best of his way to
Ogle-town that night, and so to Old-town. In the dawn of the
morning of the eleventh day, he came in sight of Duck's Creek; but
being afraid he might fall into the hands of his pursuers, he
struck a great way into the woods towards Tuck Hoe; where staying
all the day in a tree, he came again in the middle of the night to
Duck's Creek. As soon as he came here, he ran to the water side to
seek for a canoe, but found them all chained; he immediately set
himself about breaking the chain, but found it too strong, and all
endeavours to break it were in vain. Never was man more thunder-
struck than he was now, just at the time when he expected to be
out of danger, to meet with so unforeseen and insurmountable an
obstacle. He knew there was no way of escaping, but by passing the
river Delaware, and could not think of a method of effecting it.
Several hours did he pass in this agitation of mind: sometimes he
had a mind to try his strength in swimming, but the river being so
wide, he thought he could not reach the opposite shore; at last,
reflecting what one of his ancestors had done in swimming a horse
over Teignmouth bar, and seeing some horses grazing thereabout, he
resolved to attempt passing the Delaware in that manner; for, let
the worst happen, he thought death preferable to slavery. Being
thus resolved, he soon caught one of the horses, and, making a
sort of bridle with his handkerchief, brought the horse to the
water side; he walked for some time on the banks, looking for a
proper place to enter the horse: at last, espying a little stream,
which ran into the great river Deleware, he stripped himself, and,
tying his frock and trowsers about his shoulders, mounted the
horse, and putting him forward a little, the horse soon lost his
footing, and the water came up to Mr. Carew's middle, who kept his
legs as near as possible to the horse, and in this manner launched
into the great river Delaware.

The horse snorted and neighed to his companions, but made for the
opposite shore with all the strength he could. Mr. Carew did not
imagine the horse would be able to reach it, but proposed to save
himself by swimming when the horse failed, for the river was three
miles over: however the horse reached the shore, but finding no
place to land, it being a sandy mud, he was obliged to swim him
along the shore, till he came to a little creek, which the horse
swimming into, soon got sure footing, to the great joy of Mr.
Carew, who, dismounting, kissed the horse, telling him he must now
turn Quaker as well as himself, and so let him go into the woods.

His clothes were not very wet; however, he staid on the banks some
time to dry them with the morning sun, then went up into the
country. The first house he came to was a miller's, whose wife
came out and asked him from whence he came? He told her he had
been a prisoner sometime in the Havana, from whence he had been
released by an exchange of prisoners, and was now going home.

The good woman pitied him much, and told him he looked very
melancholy; but her husband coming in, said, he believed he was an
Irishman. This he denied, averring he was of the West of England;
so they gave him a piece of that country money, and a mug of rum,
which he drinking greedily, being very thirsty, it threw him into
such a violent fever, that he was obliged to stop at a
neighbouring house, where he lay sick for three or four days. From
hence he went to Newcastle, where he raised contributions from
several gentlemen, as he had done before, but not under the former
name, from hence to Castle, Brandywine Ferry, Chester, and Derby,
where he got relief from the same miller that Mr. Whitfield was
with when he was there before, and lodged at the same house, but
took care to disguise himself so as not to be known: he there got
a pass from the justice as a sick man bound to Boston. From hence
he proceeded to Brunswick, where he got relief from Mr. Matthews,
the miller, who treated him so hospitably the first time he was
there, but did not know him again now.

From hence he proceeded to New London, where he chanced to see the
captain who had taken him home before, but he avoided him. From
New London he proceeded to Groten, where he got a twenty-shilling
bill from one Mr. Goyf, and several half-crown bills from other
people. He then inquired of his landlord his way to Rhode-island,
who accompanied him about two miles of the way, when they chanced
to fall into the company of some drovers, who were driving a
number of bullocks, for the use of some privateers that lay at
Rhode Island; he therefore joined them, and, after about nine or
ten miles travelling, they came to a ferry, where they stopped at
a public-house for some time, till the bullocks were taken over;
but neither the tavern-man nor drovers would suffer him to pay
anything, they pitying his unfortunate condition: and passing over
this ferry, they came to Rhode Island.

Rhode Island, by the natives called Aquetnet, near the Narraganset
Bay, is fourteen or fifteen miles long, and four or five miles
abroad. It was first inhabited by the English in the year 1639.
Those that withdrew to this island were such as espoused the
covenant of grace, and were under great persecution from them that
sided with the covenant of works. There is a very considerable
trade from Rhode Island to the sugar colonies for butter and
cheese, a sure sign of the fruitfulness and beauty of the place,
for horses, sheep, beef, pork, tallow, and timber, from which the
traders have been enriched. It is deservedly called the Paradise
of New England, for the great fruitfulness of the soil, and the
temperature of the climate, which, though it be not above fifty-
five miles from Boston, is a coat warmer in winter, and, being
surrounded by the ocean, is not so much affected in summer with
the hot land-breezes as the towns on the continent. They live in
great amity with their neighbours, and, though every man does what
he thinks right in his own eyes, it is rare that any notorious
crimes are committed by them, which may be attributed in some
measure to their great veneration for the Holy Scriptures, which
they all read, from the least to the greatest, though they have
neither ministers nor magistrates to recommend it to them.

Here Mr. Carew found many of his old acquaintance, particularly
one Mr. Perkins, a stay-maker, and Mr. Gidley and his mother, who
kept several negroes for distilling rum, and Mr. Southeon
Lingworthy, a pewterer, all natives of Exeter, and one Mr. Martin,
of Honiton, in Devon, they were all very glad to see him; he
telling them, that he was taken by the Spaniards, and had escaped
from prison, they treated him with very great kindness, and gave
him letters to carry to their friends in England.


Chapter XXVII
A Description of the City and Harbour of Boston

From hence he went through Piscataqua and Marblehead to Boston,
the capital of New England, and the largest city in America,
except two or three on the Spanish continent. It is pleasantly
situated on a peninsula, about four miles in compass, at the
bottom of a fine bay, (the Massachusetts,) guarded from the
roughness of the ocean by several rocks appearing above water, and
by above a dozen islands, many of which are inhabited. One of
these, called Nettle's island, within these few years, was
esteemed worth two or three hundred pounds a year to the owner,
Colonel Shrimpton. There is but one common and safe passage into
the bay, and that not very broad, there being hardly room for
three ships to come in abreast; but, being once in, there is room
for the anchorage of five hundred sail.

The most remarkable of these islands is called Castle Island, from
the castle there built. It stands about a league from the town,
upon the main channel leading to it, and is so conveniently
situated, that no ship of burden can approach the town, without
the hazard of being torn in pieces by its cannon. It was now
called Fort William, being mounted with one hundred pieces of
ordnance: two hundred more which were given to the province of
Queen Anne, are placed on a platform near high water mark, so as
to rake a ship fore and aft, before she can bring her broadsides
to bear against the castle. Some of these cannon are forty-two
pounders. Five hundred able men are exempt from all military duty
in time of war, to be ready to attend the service of the castle at
an hour's warning, upon any signal of the approach of an enemy, of
which there seems to be no great danger at Boston; where in
twenty-four hours' time, ten thousand effective men, well armed,
might be ready for their defence. To prevent all possible
surprise, there is a light-house built on the rock appearing above
water, about a long league from the town, which in time of war
makes a signal to the castle, and the castle to the town, by
hoisting and lowering the union flag, so many times as there are
ships approaching, which, if they exceed a certain number, the
castle fires three guns, to alarm the town of Boston; and the
governor, if need be, orders a beacon to be fired, which alarms
all the adjacent country; so that unless an enemy can be supposed
to sail by so many islands and rocks in a fog, the town of Boston
must have six or more hours to prepare for their reception; but,
supposing they might pass the castle, there are two batteries at
the north and south end of the town that command the whole bay,
and make it impossible for an enemy's ship of any burden to ride
there in safety, while the merchant-men and small craft may retire
up into Charles River, out of the reach of cannon.

It is equally impossible for any ship to be run away with out of
this harbour by a pirate; for the castle suffers no ships outward-
bound to pass, without a permit from the governor, which is never
granted without a clearing from the custom-house, and the usual
notice of sailing, by loosening the fore-top sail.

The bay of Boston is spacious enough to contain, in a manner, the
whole navy of England. The masts of ships here, at the proper
season of the year, make a kind of a wood of trees, like that
which we see upon the river Thames about Wapping and Limehouse,
which may be easily imagined, when we consider, that, by the
computation given in by the collectors of his majesty's light-
house, it appeared that there were twenty-four thousand tons of
shipping cleared annually.

There is a larger pier at the bottom of the bay, one thousand
eight hundred, or two thousand feet in length, with a row of
warehouses on the north side. The pier runs so far into the bay,
that ships of the greatest burden may unload without the help of
boats and lighters. The chief streets of the town come down to the
head of the pier. At the upper end of it is the town-house, or
exchange, a fine building, containing, besides the walk for
merchants, the council-chambers, the house of commons, and a
spacious room for the courts of justice. The exchange is
surrounded with booksellers' shops, who have a good trade. There
are five printing-houses, at one of which the Boston Gazette is
printed, and comes out twice a week. The presses here are
generally full of work, which is in a great measure, owing to the
colleges and schools for useful learning in New England; whereas,
at New York, there is but one bookseller's shop, and none at all
in Virginia, Maryland, Carolina, Barbados, or any of the Sugar
Islands.

The town of Boston lies in the form of a half-moon round the
harbour, consisting of between three and four thousand houses, and
makes an agreeable prospect; the surrounding shore being high, the
streets long, and the buildings beautiful. The goodness of the
pavement may compare with most in London; to gallop a horse on it
is three shillings and fourpence forfeit.

It is computed the number of inhabitants is not less than twenty-
four thousand, which is one-third more than the computation of the
city of Exeter, and consequently Boston is one-third bigger than
that city, which is pretty near the matter. [Note: It is proper to
remark, that these and other computations do not apply to the
present time.]

There are ten churches in Boston, viz. Old Church, North Church,
South Church, New Church, New North Church, New South Church, the
Church of England Church, the Baptist Meeting, and the Quakers'
Meeting.

The conversation in this town is as polite as in most of the
cities and towns in England; many of their merchants having traded
in Europe, and those that stay at home having the advantage of
society with travellers; so that a gentleman from London would
think himself at home in Boston, when he observes the number of
people, their furniture, their tables, their dress, and
conversation, which perhaps is as splendid and showy as that of
the most considerable tradesmen in London. Upon the whole, Boston
is the most flourishing town for trade and commerce in all
America. Near six hundred sail of ships have been laden here in a
year for Europe and the British plantations. Here the governor
commonly resides, the general court and assembly meet, the courts
of judicature sit, and the affairs of the whole province are
transacted.

The streets are broad and regular; some of the richest merchants
have very stately, well built, convenient houses. The ground on
which the town stands is wonderfully high; and very good water is
found all over it. There are several wharfs built, which jet into
the harbour, one of which is eight hundred feet in length, where
large ships with great ease may load and unload. On one side are
warehouses almost the whole length of the wharf, where the
merchants stow their goods; and more than fifty ships may load and
unload there at the same time.


Chapter XXVIII
He Returns to England and is Reunited with his
Family

Coming into the city, Mr. Carew was surprised at the grandeur of
it; and seeing a green hill at the end of the great street, much
like Glastonbury Tower, he went up to it, and had a most beautiful
prospect of the city from the top of it, where was placed the mast
of a ship, with pulleys to draw up a lighted barrel of tar to
alarm the country in case of an invasion. Going down the hill
again he met two drummers, a sergeant, and several soldiers and
marines, who were, by the beat of drum, proclaiming, that the
taverns and shopkeepers might safely credit the soldiers and
marines to a certain value. Some of the soldiers presently knew
him, and, accosting him, persuaded him to go along them to one
Mother Passmore's, a house of rendezvous, where they were very
merry together. While they were drinking, in came Captain Sharp,
who commanded them, and who was an old acquaintance of our hero's.
What, Mr. Carew! cried the captain in a surprise, who could think
of seeing you here? When did you see my brother? I saw him,
replied he, about six months ago, but his lady is dead. Is she so?
said the captain, I have heard nothing of it. The captain having
asked him several other questions, treated him very handsomely,
and kept him some time at his own charge: but his heart glowing to
see his native country, he once more resolved to ship himself for
old England. He accordingly agreed to take the run with Captain
Ball, of the Mary, for fifteen pounds, fifteen gallons of rum, ten
pounds of sugar and tobacco, and ten pipes. They were two months
on their voyage before they made Lundy, nothing material happening
on their passage worthy of being recorded in this true history.
The captain would not stop at Lundy for a pilot, but made for
Combe, and there took one in, who brought the ship safe to King
Road, and the next tide up to the quay at Bristol; and having
moored the vessel, the crew spent the night on shore with their
jolly landladies.

The next morning early they all got on board, and soon after the
captain came with some Bristol merchants. The captain gave Mr.
Carew a bill on his brother who lived at Topsham, and having
received payment thereof, he soon turned his back on Bristol.

Mr. Carew, having left Bristol, made the best of his way to
Bridgewater, and from thence unto Taunton, and so to Exeter,
supporting his travelling expenses by his ingenuity as a
mendicant. As soon as he arrived at Exeter, he made the best of
his way to the house of an old acquaintance, where he expected to
hear some news of his beloved wife; but going through East-gate,
he was met by two gentlemen, who immediately cried out, Here's our
old friend Carew! They then laid hold of him, and took him back to 
the Oxford Inn, where they inquired where he had been this long
time. He acquainted them in what manner he had been seized, on
Topsham quay, and carried to Maryland; he likewise informed of
Captain Simmonds's death, (which they were sorry to hear of,) and
that the vessel had been carried into port by Harrison, the mate,
who was afterwards drowned, in company with some planters, in
Talbot river.

Fame having soon sounded the arrival of our hero through every
street in Exeter, several gentlemen flocked to the Oxford Inn to
visit him, and amongst the rest merchant Davy. What! have you
found your way home again? said the merchant. Yes, yes, replied
he; as you sent me over for your pleasure, I am come back for my
own; which made the gentlemen laugh very heartily. The merchant
then asked him several questions about Captain Simmonds and
Harrison, where he left the vessel, and if he had been sold. No,
no, replied he, I took care to be out of the way before they had
struck a bargain for me; and, as to the vessel, I left her in
Miles river. The gentlemen could not help being surprised at his
ingenuity and expedition, in thus getting home twice before the
vessel which carried him out. Merchant Davy then proposed making a
collection for him, and began it himself with half-a-crown; having
therefore received a handsome contribution, he returned the
gentlemen thanks, and took his leave, being impatient to hear some
news about his wife. He went directly to his usual quarters, at 
Kitty Finnimore's, Castle-lane, where he occasioned no little
terror to his landlady, she believing it to be his ghost, as she
heard he was certainly dead; however, our hero soon convinced her
he was real flesh and blood. He then inquired when she heard from
his wife, who informed him, to his great joy, that both his wife
and daughter were there a few days before, and were going towards
Newton-Bushel; but they had given over all thoughts of seeing him
any more, as they thought him dead.

He now set forward immediately for Newton-Bushel. Calling at Lord
Clifford's in his way, he was told by Mrs. Ratcliffe, the
housekeeper, and Mr. Kilshaw, the steward, (who were quite
surprised to see him,) that his wife had been there just before,
supposing him to be dead; and that he would find her at Newton-
Bushel. Though it was then night, our hero, impatient of seeing
his wife and daughter, set forward for Newton-Bushel, where he
arrived late in the night. Going directly to his usual quarters,
he found them all in bed, and calling out to the woman of the
house, his wife, hearing his voice, immediately leaped out of bed,
crying, it was her poor Bampfylde. A light was then struck with as
much expedition as possible, and his wife, daughter, and landlady,
all came down to open the door to him.

Here, how shall I find words to express the transports of our
hero, the tender embraces of his wife, the endearing words of his
daughter, and hearty congratulations of the landlady! Unable for
the task, most gentle reader, I must imitate that celebrated
painter who painted Agamemnon with a covering over his face, at
the sacrifice of his daughter, and draw a veil over this scene of
tenderness; let it suffice to say, that their joy was too full to
be contained, and, not finding any other passage, gushed out in
tears.

The next morning, accompanied by his wife and daughter, he went
and paid his respects to Sir Thomas Carew, at Hackum, where they
were received with great kindness; and Sir Thomas told him, if he
would forsake the mendicant order, he would take care to provide
for him and his family. He returned Sir Thomas a great many
thanks, but declared, that, as he had entered himself into the
mendicant order, he was resolved to continue therein as long as he
lived; but hoped if any accident happened to him, he would extend
his goodness to his dear wife and daughter.


Chapter XXIX
He Deceives the Queen, and Fools Squire Morrice
for a Bet; Going to Oxford, he Poses as a Deranged
Scholar

It was about this time, that one of the greatest personages in the
kingdom being at Bath, Mr. Carew was drawn thither with the rest
of the world to see her, but to more advantage indeed to himself
than most others reaped from it; for making himself as much an
Hanoverian as he could in his dress, &c., he presented a petition
to her as an unfortunate person of that country; and as everyone
is inclined to be kind to their own countryfolks, he had from her
a very princely benefaction.

Some time after this, Squire Morrice, who succeeded to the fine
seat and estate of Sir William Morrice, near Launceston, in
Cornwall, coming to reside there, and hearing much talk of Mr.
Carew, was very desirous of seeing him; and he happening to come
soon after into that neighbourhood, some of the servants, who knew
their master's inclinations, chancing to see him, soon conducted
him to the house, and showed him immediately into the parlour,
where Mr. Morrice was with a good deal of company. Mr. Carew was
made very welcome, and the company had a great deal of
conversation with him, during which Mr. Morrice very nicely
examined every feature in his countenance, and at last declared,
that he would lay any wager that he should know him again, come in
what shape he would, so as not to be imposed upon by him. One of
the company took Mr. Morrice up, and a wager was laid that Mr.
Carew should do it within such a limited time; this being agreed
upon, Mr. Carew took his leave. He soon began to meditate in what
shape he should be able to deceive the circumspection of Mr.
Morrice; and in a few days came to the house, and endeavoured in
two or three different shapes, and with as many different tales,
to obtain charity from Mr. Morrice, but he, remembering his wager,
would hearken to none. At last, understanding that Mr. Morrice was
to go out a hunting one morning with several of the company who
were present when the wager was laid, he dressed himself like a
neat old woman, and walking in the road where they were riding
along, all of a sudden he fell down, and so well counterfeited all
the distortion of the most violent fits in such a terrible manner,
that Mr. Morrice was greatly affected with the poor creature's
condition, ordering his servants to get down and assist her,
staying himself till she was brought a little to herself, then
gave her a piece of money, and ordered one of his servants to show
her his house, that she might have some refreshment there; but Mr.
Carew, having obtained what he desired, flung off the old woman,
and discovered himself to Mr. Morrice and the rest of the company,
wishing them all a good-morrow: upon which he owned that he had
fairly lost the wager.

Mr. Carew, some time after this, steered his course for Oxford,
where he visited Messrs. Treby, Stanford, Cooke, and other
collegians, his particular friends, of whom he got a trencher-
cap.—Having staid at Oxford as long as was agreeable to his
inclinations, he set out for Abington, and from thence to
Marlborough, having put on a pair of white stockings, a grey
waistcoat, and the trencher-cap. Thus equipped, he pretended to be
disordered in his mind; and, as his knowledge of the Latin tongue
enabled him to intermix a few Latin phrases in his discourse,
which he made very incoherent, he was in no fear of being
discovered. Under this character he, therefore, went to the
minister of Marlborough, who, seeing his dress, and finding he
could talk Latin, made no doubt but he was an Oxford scholar,
whose brain was turned, either by too much study or some
misfortune; he therefore talked to him a good deal, endeavouring
to find out the cause; telling him, that, though he was
unfortunate now, things might go better with him hereafter; but he
could get nothing but incoherent answers from him: however, he
gave him half-a-crown. From hence he went to Market-Lavington,
where he likewise deceived the minister; and going forward to
Warminster, he met with Dr. Squire, and his brother, the
Archdeacon of Bath, who both took him for an Oxford scholar whose
brain was turned, and relieved him as such.

The next morning he went in the same dress to Mrs. Groves, at
Wincanton, and from thence to the Rev. Mr. Birt's, at Sutton, at
both of which places he was much pitied, and handsomely relieved.
He then steered for Somerton, and visited the Rev. Mr. Dickenson;
but this mask would not avail him here, for the parson discovered
him through it; but he desired him to keep it secret till he was
gone out of town, which he accordingly did: he therefore went
boldly to the Rev. Mr. Keat, and pretended to be a scholar of
Baliol College, which Mr. Keat believing, and pitying his
condition, he gave him a crown.

Next day he went to Bridgewater in the same habit, and from thence
to Sir Charles Tynte's, at Haswell: going into the court, he was
met by the Rev. Mr. Standford, who immediately knew him, and
accosted him with, How do you do, friend Carew! Soon after that
came Sir Charles, who accosted him also in the same manner. Mr.
Standford and he made themselves very merry at the character he
had assumed. Well, said Sir Charles, we will make you drink, but
unless you can deceive my Bess, (so he was pleased to call his
lady,) you shall have nothing of me; but whatever she gives, I'll
double. He was then ordered into the hall, and exchanged his cap
for a hat with one of the servants; after waiting some time lady
Tynte came down. It will here be proper to observe, that this
lady, though of a very charitable disposition to her poor
neighbours, having been often deceived by mendicants, and finding
few of them deserving of her charity, had resolved to relieve no
unknown objects, however plausible their tale; but our hero,
depending upon his art, was not afraid to accept of Sir Charles's
challenge. From the servants' hall he watched a proper opportunity
of accosting the lady, and she passed and repassed several times 
before he could speak to her. At last, seeing her standing in the
hall talking with Sir Charles, he came behind her, and accosted
her with—God bless you, most gracious lady. The lady turned about
and asked him pretty hastily from whence he came? I am a poor
unfortunate man, replied he, who was taken by two French
privateers coming from Boston, and carried into Boulogne, where we
were teased day and night to enter into the French service, but
refused to do it. And how got you from thence? asked the lady. We
took an opportunity of breaking out of the prison, and seized upon
a fishing-boat in the harbour, with which we got safe to
Lymington, being in all twenty-five of us, where we sold our boat.
What do you beg for then? if you sold your boat, you must have
money. Several of us were sick, replied he, which was very
expensive. But what countryman are you? I am an Old England man,
please you, my lady, but I have my wife in Wales. From what part?
says the lady, who was a native of Wales herself. I married,
replied he, one Betty Larkey, who lived with Sir John Morgan, and
afterwards with parson Griffy, at Swansea. Ay, did you marry Betty
Larkey?—how many children have you by her? Only one daughter,
replied he. In the meantime Sir Charles and the parson were ready
to burst with containing their laughter, to see how he managed my
lady to bring her to; for his assertion of having married Betty
Larkey, who was a country-woman of my lady's, and formerly known
to her, was a loadstone which presently drew my lady's hand to her
purse; then turning to Sir Charles, she asked him if he had any
small money about him? I have none, replied Sir Charles, pretty
bluntly, being scarce able to contain himself from bursting out
into laughter; so she went upstairs, and soon returning, gave him
five shillings, and asked him to eat and drink, going out herself
to call the butler. In the meantime Sir Charles stepped nimbly
into the servant's hall, and fetched the Oxford cap, which he put
on Mr. Carew's head. The lady and butler came in immediately
after, and she, seeing the cap upon his head, cried out, God bless
me! what, did you bring that from France? It is just like one of
our Oxford scholar's caps. Ay, so it is indeed, my lady, replied
Sir Charles; why don't you know who it is? It is Bampfylde-Moore
Carew. Ay, ay, this is your doings, Sir Charles, said the lady;
and went away somewhat disgusted at the trick that had been put
upon her. Sir Charles, however, was as good as his word, in
doubling the money his lady gave, and parson Standford gave him
half-a-crown.


Chapter XXX
He Bilks Several Parsons

Some time after this, he called upon the Miss Hawkers, of Thorn,
near Yeovil, who treated him very hospitably, and inquired what
news he had heard, it being in the late rebellion. Whilst he was
talking with them, he observed a new house almost opposite, and
inquired who lived there. They told him one parson Marks, a
dissenting clergyman; upon which, taking leave of the ladies, he
stepped over the way, and knocked boldly at the door, which was
opened by the parson himself. Sir, said Mr. Carew, pulling off his
hat, and accosting him with a demure countenance, I have come two
miles out of my road on purpose to call upon you. I believe, Sir,
you are acquainted with my brother, Mr. John Pike, of Tiverton,
teacher of a dissenting congregation of that place; and you have
undoubtedly heard something of his brother Roger Pike, which
unfortunate man I am, having been taken prisoner coming from
Boston in New England, by two French privateers, and carried into
Boulogne, where we were cruelly treated. Alack, alack! said the
parson; pray come in, good Mr. Roger. I am indeed very well
acquainted with that worthy servant of God, your brother, Mr. John
Pike, and a gracious man he is; I have likewise heard him mention
his brother Roger. He then ordered some victuals and drink to be
instantly brought out for good Roger Pike. While he was eating, he
inquired how he got away from Boulogne. He replied, that twenty-
five of them had broken out of prison, and seized upon a vessel,
in the harbour, by which they had got safe to the English coast.
Well, said the parson, what news did you hear in France? It is
reported there, replied he, that the rebels are very powerful in
Scotland, and that great numbers are gone over to them safe from
France. Stop a little, Roger, cried the parson; and running
upstairs, soon after came down with a letter in his hand, which he
read to him, wherein it was said that the rebels were very
powerful; then shaking his head very sorrowfully, cried, indeed,
Mr. Pike, I cannot be at ease, for they say they will make us
examples, on account of the 30th of January. Never fear them, Sir,
said Mr. Carew; we shall be a match for them in Devonshire and
Cornwall. I am afraid not, cries the parson, shaking his head
again; I have had no rest for thinking of them these several
nights past. After some farther discourse, he fetched Mr. Pike a
good Holland shirt, and clapped a half-guinea into his hand,
entreating him to take a bed with him that night, for that he
should be heartily welcome; but he desired to be excused, and took
his leave with many thanks, and returned to Miss Hawker's again.
Well, Mr. Carew, cried the ladies, you have had a very long
conference with the parson. Ay, ay, replied he, and to good
purpose too, for this shirt and a half-guinea are the fruits of
it; and then told them in what manner he had deceived the parson,
which made them laugh very heartily; they then gave him five
shillings, and promised to keep Mr. Pike's secret for a day or
two.

A few days after, the parson going over to see the ladies, they
asked him if a poor seaman had been at his house. Yes, replied the
parson, it was one Roger Pike, whose brother had a congregation in
Tiverton, and whom I am very well acquainted with. And did you
give him any assistance? Yes, I gave him a shirt and a half-
guinea: and we gave him five shillings, said the ladies, not as
being Roger Pike, but as Mr. Bampfylde-Moore Carew; at which the
parson was in a very great hurry, and would scarce be convinced
but that it was old Roger Pike. Thus had Mr. Carew the happy art
of suiting his eloquence to every temper and every circumstance;
for his being the brother of good Mr. Pike, of Tiverton, was as
powerful a loadstone to attract the parson, as his marrying of
Betty Larkey had been to Lady Tynte.

From hence he went to parson White's, at Cocker, where he found
Justice Proctor: here he passed for an unfortunate sailor, who had
been cast away coming from the Baltic, and was now travelling to
his native place, Tintagel, in Cornwall. Parson White asked who
was minister there, he replied, that one Atkins was curate, and
that there was no other there at that time. The justice asked but
few questions, and told him he ought to have a pass, and asked
where he landed. He replied, at Dover. Had you a pass, then, from
the mayor there? We had one, said he, very readily; but some of
our company being sick, and myself in good health, I left them the
pass, and came forward by myself, they not being able to travel so
fast. Why then, says the justice, you are liable to be taken up as
a vagrant, for begging without a pass: however, we will relieve
you; and if you call upon gentlemen only, they will scarcely
molest you. He returned them a great many thanks for this
civility, and then went to a tanner's hard by, where he changed
his story, and passed for a bankrupt tanner. Here he was likewise
relieved, as he touched upon the right string; for had he passed
here for an unfortunate sailor, probably his eloquence would have
had no effect.

From hence he went to the parson of East Chinock, and told him
that he belonged to a man-of-war, in which his brother was
lieutenant. Being then about dinner time, the parson asked if he
could eat sea provisions, such as pork and peas, which he readily
accepting of, they sat down together, and had a great deal of
discourse about the lieutenant. Next he went to Madam Philips, of
Montacute, where happened to be Parson Bower, of Martock, who
asked him if he knew Bampfylde-Moore Carew? Sir, replied he, I am
of Tintagel, in Cornwall, and know the Carews there very well, and
have heard of the wanderer you speak of, who, I'm told, is a great
dog stealer, but know not what has become of him; for some say he
is hanged. God forbid he is hanged, cried the parson, upon account
of his family; and after some other questions, he was relieved
with sixpence. Leaving Montacute, he went forward to Yeovil,
having appointed to meet his wife and daughter at the sign of the
Boot, Sherborne, and from Yeovil to Squire Hellier's, at Leweston,
who treated him very handsomely, and would have had him stay there
all night, but he excused himself, being impatient to see his wife
and daughter.

As soon as he came to Sherborne, he went to his usual quarters,
the sign of the Boot, where he inquired for his wife and daughter;
but how was he thunder-struck, when he was told they were in hold,
at Webb's the bailiff! He inquired for what reason, and was
informed, that four officers had been walking all through the town
to take up all strangers, such as chimney-sweepers, tinkers,
pedlars, and the like. What could our hero do? he revolved it over
and over in his mind, and at last determined to go to Webb's,
resolving either to free his wife and daughter, or else to share
their fate. When he came there, he asked to see the prisoners, and
demanded upon what account they had apprehended his wife, as she
had neither stolen nor begged in the town: this occasioned high
words, and at last ended in blows. Long did our hero maintain an
unequal fight with great valour. At length, being overpowered with
numbers, he fell, but not till his assailants had felt the force
of his arms. He was kept in safe custody that night, and the next
morning taken, with the rest of the prisoners, before Thomas
Medlycott, Esq., at Milbourn Port, where they were all examined,
and all maintained their professions to be extremely useful. The
chimney-sweeper alleged, he preserved houses from taking fire,
whereby he saved whole towns, and consequently was a useful member
to his country. The tinker harangued on the usefulness of kettles,
brass pans, frying-pans, &c., and of consequence, what use he was
of to the public: and our hero declared he was the famous
Bampfylde-Moore Carew, and had served his king and country both by
sea and land.

The justice thought proper to send these useful men to their
respective parishes, at the public expense: accordingly Mr. Carew,
with his wife and daughter, were ordered to Bickley, in
Devonshire. The Sherborne people waited upon them to Yeovil, where
they were delivered to the care of the chief magistrate. The next
day, horses being provided, they set out for Thomas Proctor's,
Esq., at Cocker: but, he refusing to sign the pass, they proceeded
to Axminster, where the magistrate refused to receive them, on
account of the pass not being signed; upon which they would have
left Mr. Carew, but he insisted upon being accommodated to the end
of his journey, they therefore adjourned to Mr. Tucker's, about
two miles from Axminster, who asked him if he had a mind to have
his attendants dismissed, or chose to have their company to
Bickley; and he replying that he did not choose to have them
dismissed, Mr. Tucker signed the warrant, and our hero, with his
wife and daughter, rode all the way very triumphantly into
Bickley, where, as soon as they arrived, the bells were set a
ringing, and the greatest joy spread through all the place.


Chapter XXXI
He Goes to Scotland to Observe the Rebellion

Mr. Carew remained some time at Bickley, but fresh news arriving
every day of the progress of the rebels, that insatiable curiosity
which had always actuated his breast, prompted him to go and see
the army of the rebels: he therefore, taking his leave of his wife
and daughter, though they entreated him with tears not to go to
the North, made the best of his way towards Edinburgh.

After some days travel, Mr. Carew arrived at the city of
Edinburgh, which lies in a sort of a valley, between two hills,
one of which is called Salisbury Crags, the other marks the
foundation of the castle. It was strongly walled, and is adorned
with public and private buildings. At the extremity of the east
end of the city stands the palace of Holyrood house; leaving
which, a little to the left, you come through a populous suburb to
the entrance, called the Water-port. From hence, turning west, the
street goes on in a straight line through the whole city to the
castle, which is above a mile in length, and is said by the Scots
to be the largest and finest street for buildings and number of
inhabitants in Europe. From the palace door, which stands on a
level with the lowest of the plain country, this street begins to
ascend very gradually, being nowhere steep; but this ascent being
continued for so long a way, it is easy to understand that the
furthest part must be necessarily very high; for the castle, which
stands as it were at the extremity, west, as the palace does east,
makes on all sides (that only excepted which joins it to the city)
a frightful and inaccessible precipice. The castle is situated on
a high rock, and strongly fortified with a great number of towers,
so that it is looked upon as impregnable. In the great church they
have a set of bells, which are not rung out as in England, (for
that way of ringing is not now known in this country,) but are
played on by the hand with keys, like a harpsichord, the person
playing having great leather covers for his fists, which enables
him to strike with the more force; and for the larger bells there
are treadles, which he strikes with his feet.

They play all manner of tunes very musically; and the town gives a
man a yearly salary for playing upon them, from half-an-hour after
eleven till half-an-hour after twelve every day, Sundays and
holidays excepted. On the south side of this church is a square of
very fine buildings, called the Parliament Close, the west and
south side of which are mostly taken up with the Parliament house,
the several courts of justice, the council chamber, the exchequer,
the public registers, the lawyers' library, the post-office, &c.
The great church makes up the north side of the square, and the
east, and part of the south side, is built into private dwellings,
very stately, lofty, and strong, being seven stories high to the
front of the square, and the hill that they stand on having a very
deep descent; some of them are no less than fourteen stories high
backwards. Holyrood house is a very handsome building, rather
convenient than large; it was formerly a royal palace and an
abbey, founded by King David I. for the canons regular of St.
Austin, who named it Holyrood-house, or the house of the Holy
Cross, which was destroyed by Oliver Cromwell, but nobly re-
edified by King Charles the second, and of which his grace the
Duke of Hamilton is hereditary keeper; it is now almost entirely
neglected.

The entrance from the great outer court is adorned with pillars of
hewn stone, under a cupola, in form of an imperial crown,
balustraded on each side at the top. The fore part has two wings,
on each side of which are two turrets; that towards the north was
built by King James V. whose name it bears in letters of gold; and
that towards the south (as well as the rest) by Charles II,
whereof Sir William Bruce was the architect. The inner court is
very stately, all of free-stone, well hewn, with a colonnade round
it, from whence are entries into the several apartments; but above
all, the long gallery is very remarkable, being adorned with the
pictures of all the Scotch kings, from Fergus the first, done by
masterly hands. Here Mr. Carew met the rebels, but having no mind
to join them, he pretended to be very sick and lame; however, he
accosted them with, God bless you, noble gentlemen! and the rebels
moving on to Carlisle, he hopped after them, and from thence to
Manchester, and there had a sight of the Pretender's son, and
other commanders. He afterwards accompanied them to Derby, where a
report was spread, that the Duke of Cumberland was coming to fight
them; upon which, their courage failing, though the Pretender's
son was for fighting, they retreated back to Carlisle; upon which
he thought it time to leave them, and hopped homewards on his
crutches, taking care to change his note to "God bless King
George, and the brave Duke William!" Coming into Bristol, he met
with one Mr. P—, an apothecary, who had formerly known him at St.
Mary Ottery, in Devon. Mr. P— was very glad to see him, and took
him to a tavern, where he treated him very handsomely, and then
sent for his wife, sister, and other friends, to come and see him.
They were all highly pleased to see a man they had heard so much
talk of, and, after spending some hours very merrily with him,
they would have him to try his fortune in that city, but to take
care of the mint. Accordingly he went to a place of rendezvous of
the brothers of the mendicant order in Temple-street, equipped
himself in a very good suit of clothes, and then went upon the
Exchange, as the supercargo of a ship called the Dragon, which had
been burnt by lightning off the Lizard point. By this story he
raised a very handsome contribution on the merchants and captains
of vessels, it being well known that such a ship had been burnt in
the manner he described. He then returned to his friend Mr. P—,
the apothecary, and, knocking at the door, asked if he was at
home; upon which Mr. P—, came forth, and, not knowing him again in
his supercargo's dress, made him a very low bow, and desired him
to walk in. Mr. Carew asked him if he had any fine salve, as he
had met with an accident, and burnt his elbow; upon which Mr. P—
ran behind his counter, and reached down a pot of salve, desiring,
with a great deal of complaisance, the favour of looking at his
elbow; he then discovered himself, which occasioned no little
diversion to Mr. P— and his family, who made him very welcome.

Chapter XXXII
He Feigns Madness, to his Great Profit

Going back to his quarters, he laid aside his finery, and dressed
himself more meanly, like to a labouring mechanic; he then went
into the street, and acted like a madman, talking in a raving
manner about Messrs. Whitfield and Wesley, as though he was
disordered in his mind by their preaching; calling in a furious
manner at every step upon the Virgin Mary, Pontius Pilate, and
Mary Magdalen, and acting the part of a man religiously mad.
Sometimes he walked with his eyes fixed upon the ground, and then,
of a sudden, he would break out into some passionate expressions
about religion. This behaviour greatly excited the curiosity and
compassion of the people, some of whom talked to him, but he
answered everything they said in a wild and incoherent manner;
and, as compassion is generally the forerunner of charity, he was
relieved by the most of them.

The next morning he appeared in a morning-gown, still acting the
madman, and carried it so far now, as to address himself to all
the posts in the streets, as if they were saints, lifting up his
hands and eyes in a fervent though distracted manner to heaven,
and making use of so many extravagant gestures, that he astonished
the whole city. Going through Castle-street, he met the Rev. Mr.
B—o, a minister of that place, whom he accosted with his arms
thrown round him; and insisted, in a raving manner, he should tell
him who was the father of the morning star; which frightened the
parson so much, that he took to his heels and ran for it, he
running after him, till he took shelter in a house.

Having well recruited his pockets by this stratagem, he left the
city next day, and travelled towards Bath, acting the madman all
the way till he came to Bath. As soon as he came there, he
inquired for Dr. Cooney's, and being directed to his house, found
two brother mendicants at the door; after they had waited some
time, the servant brought each of them a halfpenny, for which his
brother mendicants were very thankful; but Mr. Carew gave his
halfpenny to one of them; then knocking at the door, and the maid
coming out again, Tell your master, said he, I am not a halfpenny
man, but that my name is Bampfylde-Moore Carew, king of the
mendicants, which being told, the Dr. came out with one of his
daughters, and gave him sixpence and a mug of drink, for which he
returned thanks.

The next day he went to Mr. Allen's seat, near Bath, and sent in a
petition as from a poor lunatic, by which he got half-a-crown.
From thence he made the best of his way to Shepton Mallet, when,
calling at Mr. Hooper's, and telling the servant who he was, the
mistress ordered him in, and inquired if he was really the famous
Bampfylde Carew; she then gave him five shillings, and ordered him
to be well entertained. At Shepton Mallet our hero had the
pleasure of meeting with his beloved wife, to their mutual joy and
satisfaction; and finding several brethren of the order there,
they passed some days together with much mirth and harmony.

Going near Rye, in Sussex, (where, upon account of their
extraordinary merit, the two brothers L—d are perpetually mayors,)
he met two of his mendicant subjects, who acquainted him there was
no entering the town, but with extreme hazard to his person, upon
account of the severity which the mayor exercised towards all of
their community. Mr. Carew's wife hearing this, entreated him in
the most tender manner not to venture into the town; but as his
great heart always swelled when anything hazardous presented, and
as he was willing to show his subjects, by example, that nothing
was too difficult for industry and ingenuity to overcome, he was
resolved to enter Rye; which he did with a very slow, feeble, and
tottering pace, stopping every minute by the most violent fits of
coughing, whilst every limb shook with an universal palsy, his
countenance appearing rather to be the property of some one among
the dead than to belong to any living body: in this manner he
crept along to the mayor's house, and in a most lamentable moan
begged some relief. The mayor, seeing so deplorable a figure, said
he was indeed a real object of pity; and therefore gave him a
shilling, and liberty to go through the town; which he did with no
little profit, and with great applause from the mendicants, when
they heard of his success.

Steering from thence to Dungeness, he found a vessel ready to sail
for Boulogne, on board of which he embarked, and landed safe
there; and found it so thronged with English soldiers, (it being
soon after the reducing of the army,) that had he not known the
contrary, he should have thought himself in some town in England.
Some of the soldiers knowing him, cried out, Here's Bampfylde-
Moore Carew! upon which they took him along with them to their
quarters, and they passed the day very merrily: the soldiers
expressed great discontent at their being discharged, swearing
they would never come over to England any more, saying, if they
had not come over then, they should have been either starved or
hanged. He then inquired how they lived in France? They replied,
never better in their lives. From Boulogne he set off for Calais;
where he likewise found a great multitude of English soldiers, and
more were daily coming in. Whilst he was here, the Duke of
Richmond arrived, in his way to Paris; who, seeing many English
soldiers, asked some of them why they came there? to which they
replied, they should have been either starved or hanged if they
had stayed in England. Mr. Carew intended to have paid his
respects to his grace, but had not an opportunity; and soon after,
being taken very ill, was obliged to desist from his intended
design of making a tour through France, Germany, &c.

He therefore took a passage in the packet-boat from Calais, and
landed at Dover; from hence he went to Folkstone, where he got a
pass and relief from the mayor, under the name of John Moore, a
native of St. Ives, in Cornwall, who had been cast away on the
coast of France, in a vessel coming from Ireland. Having borne
this character as long as suited his inclination, he metamorphosed
himself again, and appeared in quite a different shape. He now
wore a full handsome tie-wig, but a little changed by age; a good
beaver hat, somewhat duffy; a fine broad-cloth coat, but not of
the newest fashion, and not a little faded in its colour. He was
now a gentleman of an ancient family and good estate, but reduced
by a train of uncommon misfortunes. His venerable looks, his
dejected countenance, the visible struggles between the shame of
asking and the necessity which forced him to it, all operated to
move the pity of those he applied to, which was generally shown by
handsome contributions, for few could think of offering mites to a
gentleman of so ancient a family, and who had formerly lived so
well; and indeed how much soever we may envy the great in their
prosperity, we are as ready to relieve them in their misfortunes.

Mr. Carew happening to be in the city of Wells, in Somersetshire,
on a Sunday, was told that the bishop was to preach that morning:
upon which he slips on a black waistcoat and morning-gown, and
went out to meet the bishop as he was walking in procession, and
addressed himself to his lordship as a poor unhappy man, whose
misfortunes had turned his brain; which the bishop hearing, gave
him five shillings. From Wells he steered to Bridgewater, but did
not appear in the day-time, and went only in the evenings upon his
crutches, as a poor lame man, not being known by anyone till he
discovered himself.

Having heard that young Lord Clifford, his first cousin, (who had
just returned from his travels abroad,) was at his seat at
Callington, about four miles from Bridgewater, he resolved to pay
him a visit. In his way thither resided Parson C—, who being one
whom nature had made up in a hurry without a heart, Mr. Carew had
never been able to obtain anything of him, even under the most
moving appearance of distress, but a cup of small drink. Stopping
now in his way, he found the parson was gone to Lord Clifford's,
but being saluted at the door by a fine black spaniel, with almost
as much crustiness as he would have been, had his master been at
home, he thought himself under no stronger obligation of observing
the strict laws of honour, than the parson did of hospitality; and
therefore soon charmed the crossness of the spaniel, and made him
follow him to Bridgewater; for it is very remarkable "that the art
has been found of taming the most savage and ill-natured brutes,
which is generally attended with success; but it requires a much
higher skill, and is but seldom successful, to soften the ill-
nature and inhumanity of man: whether it is that the brutes are
more capable of receiving instruction, or whether the ill-nature
of man exceeds that of the brutes, we cannot well determine."

Having secured the spaniel, and passed the night merrily in
Bridgewater, he set out the next morning for Lord Clifford's, and
in his way called upon the parson again, who very crustily told
him he had lost his dog, and supposed some of his gang had stolen
him: to which Mr. Carew very calmly replied, What was he to his
dog, or what was his dog to him? if he would make him drink it was
well, for he was very dry: at last, with the use of much rhetoric,
he got a cup of small drink; then, taking leave of him, he went to
the Red Lion, in the same parish, where he stayed some time. In
the meantime down ran the parson to my Lord Clifford's, to
acquaint him that Mr. Carew was in the parish, and to advise him
to take care of his dogs; so that Mr. Carew, coming down
immediately after, found a servant with one dog in his arms, and
another with another: here one stood whistling and another
calling, and both my lord and his brother were running about to
seek after their favourites.

Mr. Carew asked my lord what was the meaning of this hurry, and if
his dogs were cripples, because he saw several carried in the
servants' arms: adding, he hoped his lordship did not imagine he
was come to steal any of them. Upon which his lordship told him,
that parson C— had advised him to be careful, as he had lost his
spaniel but the day before. It may be so, replied he: the parson
knows but little of me, or the laws of our community, if he is
ignorant that with us ingratitude is unknown, and the property of
our friends always sacred. His lordship, hearing this, entertained
him very handsomely, and both himself and his brother made him a
present.


Chapter XXXIII
The Miracles of Bridgewater, and the Irish
Mountebank

There being about this time a great fair at Bridgewater, in the
county of Somerset, our hero appeared there upon crutches as a
poor miserable cripple, in company with many of his subjects that
were full as unfortunate as himself, some blind, some deaf, some
dumb, &c., among whom were his old friends and school-fellows
Martin, Escott, and Coleman. The mayor of that corporation, a
bitter enemy to their community, jocosely said, that he would make
the blind see, the deaf hear, and the lame walk; and by way of
preparation or beginning to this intended cure, he had them all
apprehended and confined in a dark hole, which greatly terrified
them with the apprehension of severe punishment. After one night's
repose in limbo, he sent a physician or surgeon of most profound
skill and judgment to them, who brought the keys of their
melancholy apartments, and pretending greatly to befriend them,
advised them, if there were any of them counterfeits, to make
haste out of the town, or otherwise they must expect no mercy from
the mayor, unknown to whom he had privately stolen the keys; then,
unlocking the door, forth issued the disabled and infirm
prisoners; the lame threw aside their crutches and artificial
legs, and made an exceeding good use of their natural ones: the
blind made shift to see the way out of town; and the deaf
themselves, with great attention, hearkened to this their friend,
and followed his advice with all possible speed. The mayor, with
the aldermen and several gentlemen, planted themselves opposite to
the prison, and were spectators to this diverting scene, calling
out to stop them, not with an intention to do them any prejudice,
but only of adding a spur to their speed: however there were some
who were ready enough to lay hold on them, and our hero, in a
struggle of this nature, left a skirt of his garment behind him,
which might be done without much violence, as we may reasonably
conclude it to have been none of the soundest; and Coleman was so
closely pursued, that he plunged into the river, and swam to the
opposite shore: in short, so well did these cripples ply their
limbs, that none of them could be taken, excepting a real object,
a lame man, who, in spite of the fear and consternation he was in,
could not mend his decrepit pace: he therefore was brought before
the mayor, who, after slightly rebuking him for his vagrant course
of life, ordered him to be relieved in a very plentiful and
generous manner, and the whole corporation was exceeding kind to 
him.

One method of gaining his ends our hero had peculiar to himself.
He used with great intent to read the inscriptions on tombs and
monuments in church-yards, and when the deceased person had a
character for piety and charity, he would with the greatest
importunity apply to his or her surviving relations: and, if they
refused an alms, he would, in the most moving terms imaginable,
implore their charity for the sake of their deceased relation,
praying they would follow the laudable and virtuous example of
their dead husband, wife, father, mother, or the like; hoping
there was the same God, the same spirit of piety, religion, and
charity, still dwelling in the house as before the death of the
person deceased. These and the like expressions, uttered in a most
suppliant and pathetic voice, used to extort not only very
handsome contributions, but tears from the person to whom he
applied.

Some time after this, he engaged, at Burton, in Somersetshire, in
the habit and character of a seaman, cast away in coming from
Newfoundland, with a captain, who, by his great severity, had
rendered himself the terror of all the mendicant order; but he,
relying upon his perfect acquaintance with the country, ventured
up to him, had the best entertainment his house afforded, and was
honourably dismissed with a considerable piece of money. Captains
H—h and N—n, with both of whom our hero had sailed, were intimate
acquaintances of this captain, of whom he asked many questions,
and also about Newfoundland, which country trade he had used the
most part of the time; to all which questions he gave very
satisfactory answers. This captain had detected so many impostors,
that he concluded they were all so; but, not being able to find
Mr. Carew in anyone error, he was very proud of it, pitied and
relieved him in an extraordinary manner, went with him himself to
the principal people of the town, wrote him letters of
recommendation to his distant relations and friends, that lay in
his road, and acted with such extraordinary kindness, as if he
thought he could never do enough; it is to be remarked, that he
passed rather for a passenger than a seaman.

In the same town lived Lord B—y, who had a son, who was captain of
the Antelope man-of-war, stationed in the West Indies, and who
died on the passage; Mr. Carew informed himself of every
circumstance relating thereto, and made it his business to meet
his lordship as he came out of church. After his first
application, he gave his lordship to understand, that he was a
spectator of the burial of his son on board the Antelope; at the
same time came up this critical captain, who gave him the
character of a man of great veracity, so that his lordship gave
him a guinea, his eldest son five shillings, and also good
entertainment from the house. This happened to be a fair day; he
thereupon, going into the town, was accosted by an apothecary, who
whispered him in the ear, saying, that he knew him to be the
famous Bampfylde-Moore Carew, and had most grossly imposed upon
the captain and the town, but at the same time assured him that he
would not injure him, but faithfully keep the secret. In the
meantime there was an Irish quack-doctor in view, who had gathered
the whole market around him, and who, with more strength of lungs
than sense of argument, most loudly harangued, entertaining them
in a very florid manner with the sovereign virtues of his pills,
plasters, and self; and so far did he impose upon them, as to vend
his packets pretty plentifully, which the apothecary could not
forbear beholding with an envious eye, and jocularly asked Mr.
Carew if he could not help him to some revenge upon this dangerous
rival and antagonist of his; which he promised him to do
effectually.

Accordingly he got a little phial, and filled it up with spirits
of turpentine; he then mixed in with the gaping auditory of this
Irish itinerant physician, who was in the midst of them, mounted
on his steed adorned with a pompous curb-bridle, with a large
parcel of all-curing medicines in his bags behind him, and was
with a great deal of confidence and success, Aesculapius-like,
distributing health around him: we must observe, that our
physician had taken his stand among the stalls of orange and
gingerbread merchants, shoemakers, glovers, and other such
retailers.

Mr. Carew therefore approached him, and planted himself close by
the horse, and, wetting his fingers with the spirits, rested his
hand upon the steed, as an unconcerned person might have done; at
the same time putting aside the hair, he rubbed the turpentine
upon the bare flesh, which immediately beginning to burn and
smart, the afflicted quadruped began to express his sense of pain,
by flinging his hinder legs, gently shaking himself, and other
restless motions, which made the poor mountebank wonder what had
befallen his horse; but the pain increasing, the disorderly
behaviour of the steed increased proportionably, who now began to
kick, prance, stand on end, neigh, immoderately shake himself,
utterly disregarding both his bridle and rider, and running a tilt
against the stalls of oranges, gingerbread, gloves, breeches,
shoes, &c., which he overthrew and trampled underfoot; this
occasioned a scramble among the boys for the eatables, and there
were some who were but too unmerciful to the scattered goods of
the poor shoemakers and glovers, who, enraged by their several
losses, began to curse the doctor and his Rosinante, who was all
this while capering, roaring, and dancing among their oranges,
panniers of eggs, &c., to the entire ruin of the hucksters, who
now began to deal very heavy blows, both on the unfortunate horse
and his distressed master. This odd spectacle and adventure
attracted the eyes and attention of the whole fair, which was all
in an uproar, some laughing, some crying, (particularly the poor
suffering pedlars,) some fighting, and others most unmercifully
cursing and swearing; to make short of the story, the doctor rode
about the fair, without either hat or wig, at the pleasure and
discretion of his horse, among the ruined and overturned stalls
and the dissipated mob, who concluded both the quack and the steed
to be either mad or bewitched, and enjoyed their frolicsome
situation.

The doctor, being no longer able to keep his seat, fell headlong
into the miry street; the horse ran into a river, and rolled
himself over several times, to the entire confusion and ruin of
the inestimable pills and plasters; the doctor employed a good
farrier, and after some time the horse came to himself again. The
reader may very easily judge what glorious diversion this was for
the apothecary and Mr. Carew, who were spectators of the whole
scene. He was treated handsomely upon this account, not only by
the apothecary, but all others of the same profession in the town,
and several other gentlemen.

Upon Mr. Carew's departure from Burton, the generous captain
befriended him with many recommendatory letters to friends and
acquaintance, that lay in his road, as he pretended: nay, indeed,
he was never out of it; thence he proceeded to Bristol, and other
places where the letters were directed to, and received
considerable sums of money from many, on account of these letters,
which were mostly to captains of vessels, and gentlemen that had
been at sea, with whom he several times passed muster very well;
it being by desire of the captain, as was mentioned in the
letters, that they examined him.


Chapter XXXIV
He turns Conjurer; and is Revenged on the
Uncharitable

Sometimes he and his wife, in conjunction with Coleman and his
wife, being all dressed genteelly, passed for Gypsies of
extraordinary knowledge and reputation: many a poor credulous
unsuspecting person became their prey, and many a good booty they
got in almost every town of the counties of Cornwall and Devon.
Once in particular, himself and Coleman, with both their spouses,
being in Buckford-sleigh, near Exeter, one Mr. Collard, a wealthy
but simple shoemaker, came to their quarters, to consult them on a
very intricate and important affair; he told them, "that it was
the opinion of everybody in the country, that his grandmother had
somewhere concealed very large sums of money before her death, and
that himself, by several dreams, was confirmed in the same
opinion, and that he thought proper to advise with them upon the
affair; not doubting but they, by the help of their profound
learning and knowledge, for which they were so famous through the
west, were capable of informing him in what particular place he
might find this particular treasure, which if they would discover
to him, he would give them thirty guineas."

Our magicians, after long deliberation and consultation with their
books, told him, "that if he would that night take a walk with one
of them, he would see the spirit of his grandmother; that he must
not be afraid of the apparition, but follow it till it vanished
away, and in that individual spot of ground from which the ghost
vanished, there he would find the hidden treasure."

In order for the execution of this scheme, Coleman put a woman's
cap on his head, washed his face, and sprinkled meal on it while
wet, stuck the broken pieces of a tobacco-pipe between his teeth,
and wrapping his body in a white sheet, planted himself in the
road that Collard and Mr. Carew were to come; the moon at this
time shone very bright, which gave an additional horror to the
pretended spectre. Our hero, by virtue of his supposed profound
learning and most mysterious science, spoke to it in an unknown
language, to the following effect:—High, mort, bush rumley to the
toggy cull, and ogle him in the muns; at which command the
terrific hobgoblin fiercely advanced up to poor Collard, and with
a most ghastly look stared him in the face; the shoemaker was
greatly terrified thereat, and shook and trembled as if a fit of
the ague had been upon him, and, creeping close to Mr. Carew, laid
fast hold of his clothes, imagining he had sufficient power to
protect him from the threatening appearance of this insolent
apparition; whereupon he bid the ghost, hike to the vile; and
would have persuaded the frightened Collard to have followed his
departing grandmother, in order to observe the particular place
from which she vanished; but no persuasions of his could induce
him to move from his side.

They then returned to the alehouse they had left, and Mr. Carew
(this method of conjuration miscarrying through the shoemaker's
fear,) cast a figure, and informed Crispin, that, if he took up
two or three planks of the floor of his little parlour, he would
there find the concealed treasure, at the depth of about three or
four feet: upon his hearing this joyful news, the shoemaker
instantly disbursed the thirty guineas, highly extolling them as
people of the profoundest skill that he had ever heard of or
conversed with: but whether he was of the same opinion when he
came to dig for the treasure, we will not take upon us to say—but
we may suppose the contrary.

Happening, a short time after this, to be in Brakeness, near
Lymington, in the character of a cast-away seaman, he went to the
house of Mr. Joseph Haze, an eminent and wealthy Presbyterian
parson, of whom he begged relief, in the most earnest manner he
was able, for God's sake, with uplifted eyes and hands, and upon
his bended knee; but could not with all his importunity and
eloquence obtain a crust of bread, or a draught of small beer. Mr.
Carew, not accustomed to be unsuccessful in his applications,
could by no means brook this churlishness of the parson, and
thought it highly necessary, for the benefit of his community,
that it should not go unpunished. He was a great sportsman, and
had two fine greyhounds, the one named Hector, the other Fly; and
two excellent spaniels, Cupid and Dido, and an admirable setting
dog, called Sancho. Our hero, therefore, about twelve o'clock on
the same night, paid a second visit to the parson's house, and
brought away all these fine dogs with him. And afterwards he sent
a letter to the parson, to this purpose:—

"REV. SIR,
	"You err, if you suspect yourself to have been wronged of
your dogs by any of your neighbours; the cast-away seaman, who
begged so earnestly, for the love of God, to whom you would not
vouchsafe a crust of bread, or a draught of small beer, took them
away, to teach you another time to behave to unfortunate strangers
more as becomes your profession, and your plentiful circumstances."

The mayor of Weymouth, in Dorsetshire, fared little better at his
hands. This gentleman was an implacable enemy to all Mr. Carew's
subjects. He therefore, happening to be in that town, and
overhearing the mayor talking to a gentleman in the street, and
saying that he was going to dine with Captain Colloway, of Upton,
he thought this a proper opportunity for taking some revenge of
the mayor, for the many indignities he had put on his subjects.
Having soon got intelligence what suits of clothes the mayor had,
and understanding he had a good snuff-coloured suit, he went to
his house, and informed the lady mayoress that he was a seaman
under misfortunes, had met with the mayor, as he was going to
dinner at Captain Colloway's, of Upton, and his honour had sent
him to her, giving him orders to receive his snuff-coloured suit
of clothes from her; which the good natured gentlewoman hearing,
without the least scruple, quickly brought him the coat,
waistcoat, and breeches. Thus our hero, by turning his natural
ingenuity to account, procured a handsome suit of clothes, while,
at the same time, he was revenging himself upon his enemy;
fulfilling the old proverb of killing two dogs with one stone. It
is unnecessary to say, that our hero departed from Weymouth
forthwith.


Chapter XXXV
Further Adventures, and the End of our Story

Mr. Carew being in Bristol, at a time when there was a hot press,
wherein they not only impressed seamen, but able-bodied landsmen
they could anywhere meet with, which made some fly one way, and
some another, putting the city into a great rout and
consternation, he, among the rest, knowing himself to have a body
of rather a dangerous bigness, he was willing to secure himself as
effectually as he possibly could, greatly preferring his own ease
to the interest and honour of his king. He therefore set his wife
and landlady to work, who with all speed, and proper attention to
cleanliness, made a great number of small mutton-pies, plum-
puddings, cheesecakes, and custards, which our hero, in the
ordinary attire of a female vender of these commodities, hawked
about the city, crying, Plum-pudding, plum-pudding, plum-pudding;
hot plum-pudding; piping hot, smoking hot, hot plum-pudding. Plum-
pudding echoed in every street and corner, even in the midst of
the eager press-gang, some of whom spent their penny with this
masculine pie-woman, and seldom failed to serenade her with many a
complimentary title, such as b— and w—.

Arriving at Squire Rhodes's seat, near King's-bridge in
Devonshire, and knowing the squire had married a Dorsetshire lady,
he thought proper also to become a Dorsetshire man, and of Lyme,
which was the place of the lady's nativity, and applied himself to
the squire and his lady, whom he met both together, giving them to
understand that he was lost in a vessel belonging to Lyme. The
squire and his lady gave him five shillings each, for country's
sake, and entertained him very well at their own house. This was
early in the forenoon, and he wished to put off his time a little,
before proceeding upon another adventure.

Going from hence, he went to a public-house, called Malston-cross,
about a quarter of a mile from the squire's; he there fell into
company with Squire Reynolds, Squire Ford, Dr. Rhodes, brother to
the squire, and several other gentlemen, who were met there to
make happy after a hunting-match, in which they had been
uncommonly successful, and were much inclined to be jovial. In the
afternoon there was a terrific storm of rain, thunder, and
lightning, that continued with great violence for several hours:
in the midst of this tempestuous weather, he (having a great mind
to clear his afternoon's expenses) stripped off all his apparel,
except his nightcap, shoes, and breeches, and went to Squire
Rhodes's. Nothing could possibly look with a more deplorable
appearance than this naked and wretched spectacle, in such
dreadful weather: the landlord with pity regarding his destitute
appearance, fetched him a shirt, as he thought, to cover his
nakedness; but upon his endeavouring to put it on, it proved to be
a smock belonging to the good woman of the house, which afforded a
great deal of diversion to the good squire and his benevolent
lady, who happened to be looking from their window enjoying the
mistake; when, calling to him, and inquiring from whence he came,
he pretended to have been cast away at Bigbury-bay, during the
late violent tempest, in a vessel belonging to Poole. Squire
Rhodes ordered a fine Holland shirt, and a suit of good clothes to
be given to him, as also a hearty refreshing dram; and then,
throwing him half-a-crown, dismissed him, not in the least
suspecting him to be the poor Lyme man, to whom he and his lady
were so liberal in the morning. Having got this contribution, he
returned to the public-house, where the gentlemen waited for him
(for they were the principal occasion of this last adventure); and
being informed how he had fared, diverted themselves exceedingly
with the stratagem; and shortly after, meeting with Squire Rhodes,
they discovered the various impositions that had been practised
upon him, and very heartily bantered him thereupon.

Some time after this, Mr. Carew, exercising his profession at
Modbury (where squire Rhodes's father lived), among other houses
made his application to Legassick's, where he by chance was
visiting. Mr. Carew knocked at the kitchen door, which being
opened, he saw his old friend the squire, who was then alone, and
in a careless manner swinging his cane about. As soon as he began
to tell his lamentable tale, Mr. Rhodes said, "I was twice in one
day imposed on by that rogue, Bampfylde Carew, to whose gang you
may very likely belong; furthermore, I do not live here, but am a
stranger." Meantime in comes Mr. Legassick, with a bottle of wine
in his hand, giving Mr. Carew a private wink, to let him
understand that he knew him, and then very gravely inquired into
the circumstances of his misfortune, as also of the affairs and
inhabitants of Dartmouth, from whence he pretended to have sailed
several times; of all which he gave a full and particular account;
upon which Mr. Legassick gave him half-a-crown, and recommended
him as a real object to Mr. Rhodes, who also made the same
present; upon which Mr. Legassick burst out laughing; and, being
asked the reason thereof, he could not forbear telling him, even
in Mr. Carew's presence; when Mr. Rhodes, finding himself a third
time imposed on, with a great deal of good nature made himself
very merry therewith.

Mr. Carew being now advanced in years, and his strength beginning
to fail, he was seized with a violent fever, which confined him to
his bed for several weeks; on recovering he reflected how idly he
had spent his life, and came to the resolution of resigning the
Egyptian sceptre.  The assembly finding him determined,
reluctantly complied, and he departed amidst the applause, as well
as the regrets of his subjects, who despaired of ever again having
such a king.

Our hero returned home to the place of his nativity, but finding
the air of the town not rightly to agree with him, and the death
of some of his relations rendering his circumstances quite easy,
he retired to the west country, where he purchased a neat cottage,
which he embellished in a handsome style, and lived in a manner
becoming a good old English gentleman, respected by his
neighbours, and beloved by the poor, to whom his doors were ever
open.  Here he died, full of years and honours, regretted by all.

Having left his daughter a handsome fortune, she was married to a
neighbouring gentleman of good family, by whom she had a numerous
family of promising children.

Here we shall put an end, for the present, to this true history of
our hero, and we hope, the gentle reader is convinced that he has
as good, if not a better, claim to fame and immortality than most
of the present heroes of the age. We acknowledge he has his
faults, but everybody knows a perfect character is quite out of
fashion, and that the present excellent writers of the age hold it
a solecism and absurdity to draw even a fictitious hero without
plenty of faults. To draw after nature is the criterion; that is,
an equal quantity of virtue and vice; or, if the latter
preponderate a little, no matter, so their heroes do not fall
without temptation, and feel some compunctions of repentance when
their passions are cooled; this is perfection enough, for this is
pure nature. Upon this account, we acknowledge we have been at no
little pains in writing this true history, to throw a veil over
some of the virtues of hero, lest he should be found to exceed the
present standard of heroism, and be thought a character out of
nature.
