ENGLISH AS SHE IS SPOKE
(O Novo Guia da Conversacao em Portuguez e Inglez)
By
Jose da Fonseca and Pedro Carolino


Introduction to the British edition
by
James Millington

FROM the time of Shakspere downwards, wits and authors
innumerable have made themselves and the public more or less merry
at the expense of the earlier efforts of the student of a strange
tongue; but it has been reserved to our own time for a soi-disant
instructor to perpetrate -- at his own expense -- the monstrous
joke of publishing a Guide to Conversation in a language of which
it is only too evident that every word is utterly strange to him.
The Teutonic sage who evolved the ideal portrait of an elephant
from his "inner consciousness" was a commonplace, matter-of-fact
person compared with the daring visionary who conjures up a
complete system of language from the same fertile but
untrustworthy source. The piquancy of Senhor Pedro Carolino's New
Guide of the Conversation in Portuguese and English is enhanced by
the evident bona fides and careful compilation of "the little
book," or as Pedro himself gravely expresses it, "for the care
what we wrote him, and for her typographical correction."

In short, the New Guide of the Conversation in Portuguese and
English was written with serious intent, and for the purpose of
initiating Portuguese students into the mysteries of the English
language. The earlier portions of the book are divided into three
columns, the first giving the Portuguese; the second what, in the
opinion of the author, is the English equivalent; and the third
the English equivalent phonetically spelt, so that the tyro may at
the same time master our barbarous phraseology and the
pronunciation thereof. In the second part of the work the learner
is supposed to have sufficiently mastered the pronunciation of the
English language, to be left to his own devices.

A little consideration of the shaping of our author's English
phrases leads to the conclusion that the materials used have been
a Portuguese-French phrase-book and a French-English dictionary.
With these slight impedimenta has the daring Lusitanian ventured
upon the unknown deep of a strange language, and the result, to
quote again from the Preface, "May be worth the acceptation of the
studious persons, and especially of the Youth, at which we
dedicate him particularly," but will at all events contribute not
a little to the Youth's hilarity.

To begin with the vocabulary; it is perhaps hardly fair to
expect a professor of languages to trouble himself with "Degrees
of Kindred," still, such titles as "Gossip mistress, a relation,
an relation, a guardian, an guardian, the quatergrandfather, the
quater-grandmother," require some slight elucidation, and passing
over the catalogue of articles of dress which are denominated
"Objects of Man" and "Woman Objects," one may take exception to
"crumbs" and "groceries," which are inserted among plates and
cruets as ordinary table garniture.

Among what are denominated "Eatings" we find "some wigs," "a
dainty dishes," "a mutton shoulder," "a little mine," "hog-fat,"
and "an amelet": the menu is scarcely appetising, especially when
among "Fishes and Shellfishes" our Portuguese Lucullus sets down
the "hedgehog," "snail," and "wolf." After this such trifles as
"starch" arranged under the heading of "Metals and Minerals," and
"brick" and "whitelead" under that of "Common Stones" fall almost
flat; but one would like to be initiated into the mysteries of
"gleek," "carousal," and "keel," which are gravely asserted to be
"Games." Among "Chivalry Orders" one has a glimmering of what is
intended by "Saint Michaelmas" and "Very-Merit"; but under the
heading of "Degrees," although by a slight exercise of the
imagination we can picture to ourselves "a quater master," "a
general to galeries," or even a "vessel captain," we are entirely
nonplussed by "a harbinger" and "a parapet."

Passing on to "Familiar Phrases," most of which appear to be
old friends with new faces, Senhor Carolino's literal cribs from
the French become more and more apparent, in spite of his boast in
the Preface of being "clean of gallicisms and despoiled phrases."
"Apply you at the study during that you are young" is doubtless an
excellent precept, and as he remarks further on "How do you can it
to deny"; but study may be misdirected, and in the moral, no less
than in the material world, it is useful to know "That are the
dishes whom you must be and to abstain"; while the meaning of
"This girl have a beauty edge" is scarcely clear unless it relates
to the preternatural acuteness of the fair sex in these days of
board schools and woman's rights.

Further on the conversationalist appears to get into rough
company, and we find him remarking "He laughs at my nose, he jest
by me," gallicé "Il me rit au nez, il se moque de moi"; "He has me
take out my hairs," "He does me some kicks," "He has scratch the
face with hers nails," all doubtless painfully translated with the
assistance of a French-English dictionary from "Il m'a arrachê des
cheveux," "Il me donne des coups de pied," "Il m'a laceré la
figure de ses ongles." It is noticeable that our instructor as a
rule endeavours to make the possessive pronoun agree with the
substantive in number and gender in orthodox Portuguese fashion,
and that like a true grammatical patriot he insists upon the
substantive having the same gender as in his native tongue;
therefore "as unhas "must be rendered "hers nails" and "vossas
civildades" "yours civilities." By this time no one will be
disposed to contradict our inimitable Pedro when he remarks "É
facéto," giving the translation as "He has the word for to laugh,"
a construction bearing a suspicious resemblance to "Il a le mot
pour rire." "He do the devil at four" has no reference to an
artful scheme for circumventing the Archfiend at a stated hour,
but is merely a simulacrum of the well-known gallic idiomatic
expression "Il fait le diable à quatre." Truly this is excellent
fooling; Punch in his wildest humour, backed by the whole colony
of Leicester Square, could not produce funnier English. "He burns
one's self the brains," "He was fighted in duel," "They fight
one's selfs together," "He do want to fall," would be more
intelligible if less picturesque in their original form of "Il se
brûle la cervelle," "Il s'est battu en duel," "Ils se battent
ensemble," "Il manque de tomber." The comic vein running through
the "Familiar Phrases" is so inexhaustible that space forbids
further quotation from this portion of the book, which may be
appropriately closed with "Help to a little most the better yours
terms," a mysterious adjuration, which a reference to the original
Portuguese leads one to suppose may be a daring guess at
"Choisissez un peu mieux vos paroles."

In the second part, entitled "Familiar Dialogues," the fun
grows fast and furious. Let us accompany our mad wag upon "The
walk." "You hear the bird's gurgling?" he enquires, and then
rapturously exclaims "Which pleasure! which charm! The field has
by me a thousand charms "; after this, to the question "Are you
hunter? will you go to the hunting in one day this week?" he
responds "Willingly; I have not a most pleasure in the world.
There is some game on they cantons." Proceeding from "game" to
"gaming" we soon run aground upon the word "jeu," which as we know
does duty in French both for a game and a pack of cards. "At what
pack will you that we does play?" "To the cards." Of course this
is "A quel jeu voulez vous que nous jouions? ""Aux cartes;" and
further on "This time I have a great deal pack," "Cette fois jai
un jeu excellent."

Now let us listen to our friend at his tailor's: his greeting
is perky -- almost slangy. "Can you do me a coat?" he enquires,
but quickly drivels down to "What cloth will you do to?" and then
to the question "What will you to double (doubler) the coat?"
obtains the satisfactory answer "From something of duration. I
believe to you that." After requesting to have his garment "The
rather that be possible," he overwhelms the procrastinating man of
cloth with the stern remark "You have me done to expect too,"
evidently a bold version of "Vous n'avez fait trop attendre,"
which draws forth the natural excuse "I did can't to come rather."
Passing by a number of good things which one would like to analyse
if space permitted, we arrive at "For to ride a horse," a fine
little bit of word painting almost Carlylean in its grotesqueness.
"Here is a horse who have a bad looks. He not sall know to march,
he is pursy, he is foundered. Don't you are ashamed to give me a
jade as like? he is undshoed, he is with nails up; it want to lead
to the farrier." "Let us prick (piquons) go us more fast, never I
was seen a so much bad beast; she will not nor to bring forward 
neither put back." "Strek him the bridle," cries the horsedealer,
"Hold him the reins sharters." "Pique stron gly, make to marsh
him." "I have pricked him enough. But I can't to make marsh him,"
replies the indignant client. "Go down, I shall make marsh,"
declares the dealer; upon which the incensed equestrian rejoins
"Take care that he not give you a foot kicks," and the "coper"
sardonically but somewhat incoherently concludes with "Then he
kicks for that I look? Sook here if I knew to tame hix."

After the "Familiar Dialogues" we come upon a series of
letters from celebrated personages, who would be puzzled to
recognize themselves in their new dresses; and a collection of
anecdotes which may be taken singly after dinner as a gentle
promoter of digestion; the whole being appropriately concluded
with "Idiotisms and Proverbs," between which it must be confessed
the distinction is purely imaginary; the following are a few gems:
"Its are some blu stories "(contes bleus); "Nothing some money,
nothing some Swiss," "He sin in trouble water" (confusion of
pêcher and pécher.) "A horse baared don't look him the tooth,"
"The stone as roll not heap up not foam," mousse meaning both foam
and moss, of course the wrong meaning is essential to a good
"idiotism." "To force to forge, becomes smith" (a force de forger
on devient forgeron). "To craunch the marmoset "and "To fatten the
foot" may terminate the list, and are incontestably more idiotic,
although scarcely so idiomatic as "Croquer le marmot" and
"Graisser la patte."

The column in Portuguese which runs throughout the original
work is omitted, and only a sufficient number of the English
extracts are culled to enable the reader to form a just idea of
the unintentionally humorous style that an author may fall into
who attempts to follow the intricacies of "English as she is
spoke" by the aid of a French dictionary and a phrase-book.

It is to be trusted the eccentric "Guide" to which this short
sketch is intended to serve as Introduction -- and, so far as may
be, elucidation -- is not a fair specimen of Portuguese or
Brazilian educational literature; if such be the case the
schoolmaster is indeed "abroad," and one may justly fear that his
instruction -- to quote once more the Preface -- "only will be for
to accustom the Portuguese pupils or foreign, to speak very bad
any of the mentioned idioms."


Introduction to the U.S. edition
by
Mark Twain (Samuel Clemens)

In this world of uncertainties, there is, at any rate, one
thing which may be pretty confidently set down as a certainty: and
that is, that this celebrated little phrase-book will never die
while the English language lasts. Its delicious unconscious
ridiculousness, and its enchanting naiveté, as are supreme and
unapproachable, in their way, as are Shakespeare's sublimities.
Whatsoever is perfect in its kind, in literature, is imperishable:
nobody can imitate it successfully, nobody can hope to produce its
fellow; it is perfect, it must and will stand alone: its
immortality is secure.

It is one of the smallest books in the world, but few big
books have received such wide attention, and been so much pondered
by the grave and learned, and so much discussed and written about
by the thoughtful, the thoughtless, the wise, and the foolish.
Long notices of it have appeared, from time to time, in the great
English reviews, and in erudite and authoritative philological
periodicals; and it has been laughed at, danced upon, and tossed
in a blanket by nearly every newspaper and magazine in the
English-speaking world. Every scribbler, almost, has had his
little fling at it, at one time or another; I had mine fifteen
years ago. The book gets out of print, every now and then, and one
ceases to hear of it for a season; but presently the nations and
near and far colonies of our tongue and lineage call for it once
more, and once more it issues from some London or Continental or
American press, and runs a new course around the globe, wafted on
its way by the wind of a world's laughter.

Many persons have believed that this book's miraculous
stupidities were studied and disingenuous; but no one can read the
volume carefully through and keep that opinion. It was written in
serious good faith and deep earnestness, by an honest and upright
idiot who believed he knew something of the English language, and
could impart his knowledge to others. The amplest proof of this
crops out somewhere or other upon each and every page. There are
sentences in the book which could have been manufactured by a man
in his right mind, and with an intelligent and deliberate purposes
to seem innocently ignorant; but there are other sentences, and
paragraphs, which no mere pretended ignorance could ever achieve -
- nor yet even the most genuine and comprehensive ignorance, when
unbacked by inspiration.

It is not a fraud who speaks in the following paragraph of
the author's Preface, but a good man, an honest man, a man whose
conscience is at rest, a man who believes he has done a high and
worthy work for his nation and his generation, and is well pleased
with his performance: "We expect then, who the little book (for
the care what we wrote him, and for her typographical correction)
that may be worth the acceptation of the studious persons, and
especially of the Youth, at which we dedicate him particularly."

One cannot open this book anywhere and not find richness. To
prove that this is true, I will open it at random and copy the
page I happen to stumble upon. Here is the result:

DIALOGUE 16 
For To See the Town

Anothony, go to accompany they gentlemen, do they see the town. 
We won't to see all that is it remarkable here. 
Come with me, if you please. I shall not forget nothing what can
to merit your attention. Here we are near to cathedral; will you
come in there? 
We will first to see him in outside, after we shall go in there
for to look the interior. 
Admire this master piece gothic architecture's. 
The chasing of all they figures is astonishing' indeed. 
The cupola and the nave are not less curious to see. 
What is this palace how I see yonder? 
It is the town hall. 
And this tower here at this side? 
It is the Observatory. 
The bridge is very fine, it have ten arches, and is constructed of
free stone. 
The streets are very layed out by line and too paved. 
What is the circuit of this town? 
Two leagues. 
There is it also hospitals here? 
It not fail them. 
What are then the edifices the worthiest to have seen? 
It is the arsnehal, the spectacle's hall, the Cusiomhouse, and the
Purse. 
We are going too see the others monuments such that the public
pawnbroker's office, the plants garden's, the money office's, the
library. 
That it shall be for another day; we are tired. 

DIALOGUE 17 
To Inform One'self of a Person

How is that gentilman who you did speak by and by? 
Is a German. 
I did think him Englishman. 
He is of the Saxony side. 
He speak the french very well. 
Tough he is German, he speak so much well italyan, french, spanish
and english, that among the Italyans, they believe him Italyan, he
speak the frenche as the Frenches himselves. The Spanishesmen
believe him Spanishing, and the Englishes, Englishman.
It is difficult to enjoy well so much several langages.

The last remark contains a general truth; but it ceases to be
a truth when one contracts it and applies it to an individual --
provided that individual is the author of this book, Senhor Pedro
Carolino. I am sure I should not find it difficult "to enjoy well
so much several langages" -- or even a thousand of them -- if he
did the translating for me from the originals into his ostensible 
English.


Author's Preface

A choice of familiar dialogues, clean of gallicisms, and
despoiled phrases, it was missing yet to studious portuguese and
brazilian Youth; and also to persons of others nations, that wish
to know the portuguese language. We sought all we may do, to
correct that want, composing and divising the present little work
in two parts. The first includes a greatest vocabulary proper
names by alphabetical order; and the second fourty three Dialogues
adapted to the usual precisions of the life. For that reason we
(lid put, with a scrupulous exactness, a great variety own
expressions to english and portuguese idioms; without to attach us
selves (as make some others) almost at a literal translation;
translation what only will be for to accustom the portuguese
pupils, or-foreign, to speak very bad any of the mentioned idioms.

We were increasing this second edition with a phraseology, in
the first part. and some familiar letters, anecdotes, idiotisms,
proverbs, and to second a coin's index.

The Works which we were confering for this labour, fond use
us for nothing; but those what were publishing to Portugal, or
out, they were almost all composed for some foreign, or for some
national little aquainted in the spirit of both languages. It was
resulting from that corelessness to rest these Works fill of
imperfections, and anomalies of style; in spite of the infinite
typographical faults which some times invert the sense of the
periods. It increase not to contain any of those Works the figured
pronunciation of the english words, nor the prosodical accent in
the portuguese: indispensable object whom wish to speak the
english and portuguese languages correctly.

We expect then, who the little book (for the care what we
wrote him. and for her typographical correction) that may he worth
the acceptation of the studious persons, and especialy of the
Youth, at which we dedicate him particularly.
