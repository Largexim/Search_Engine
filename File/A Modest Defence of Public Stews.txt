Bibliographic and Editorial Note.

A Modest Defence of Public Stews or An Essay upon Whoring was
published in 1724 and in a second edition the following year. The
author was given as "A Layman" but it is generally regarded as the
work of Bernard Mandeville, a Dutch doctor resident in England who
wrote extensively on social and political questions. The book was
republished several times in the next twenty years, under various
pseudonyms. This version has been taken from a facsimile of an
edition published in 1740 and ascribed to "The late Colonel Harry
Mordaunt" (see title page). Spelling and capitalisation have been
standardised and a few misprints silently corrected. The notes are
the work of the Ex-Classics Project.

To the Most Valuable Good-for-nothing FEMALE Living

MUST Interest to Honour be preferred?
To save my Credit, shall I break my Word?
I know not how to steer in such a Storm:
Rashly I spoke, more rashly still perform.
My Zeal to Truth, at least, you will approve,
Though Truth weighs little in the Scales of Love.
Still upon that alone 'tis I depend
So bold a Gamester rarely gains his End:
I stake the Lover down to win the Friend.



Dedication

TO THE GENTLEMEN OF THE SOCIETIES FOR REFORMATION OF MANNERS.


Gentlemen,

THE great pains and diligence you have employed, in the defence of
modesty and virtue, give you an undisputed title to the address of
this treatise; though it is with the utmost concern that I find
myself under a necessity of writing it, and that after so much
reforming, there should be anything left to say upon the subject,
besides congratulating you upon happy success. It is no small
addition to my grief to observe, that your endeavours to suppress
lewdness, have only served to promote it; and that this branch of
immorality has grown under your hands, as if it was pruned instead
of being lopped. But however your ill success may grieve, it cannot
astonish me: what else could we hope for, from your persecuting of
poor strolling damsels? From your stopping up those drains and
sluices we had to let out lewdness? From your demolishing those
horn-works and breast-works of modesty? Those ramparts and ditches
within which the virtue of our wives and daughters lay so
conveniently entrenched? An entrenchment so much the safer, by how
much the ditches were harder to be filled up. Or what better could
we expel, from your carting of bawds, than that the great leviathan
of lechery, for want of these tubs to play with, should with one
whisk of his tail, overset the vessel of modesty? Which, in her best 
trim, we know to be somewhat leaky, and to have a very unsteady
helm.

An ancient philosopher compares lewdness to a wild, fiery, and head-
strong young colt, which can never be broke till he is rid into a
bog: and Plato, on the same subject, has these words: The Gods, says
he, have given us one disobedient and unruly member, which, like a
greedy and ravenous animal that wants food, grows wild and furious
till having imbibed the fruit of the common thirst he has
plentifully besprinkled and bedewed the bottom of the womb.

And now I have mentioned the philosophers, I must beg your patience
for a moment, to hear a short account of their amours: for nothing
will convince us of the irresistible force of love, and the folly of
hoping to suppress it, sooner than reflecting, that those venerable
sages, those standards of morality, those great reformers of the
world, were so sensibly touched with this tender passion.

Socrates confessed, that, in his old age, he felt a strange tickling 
all over him for five days, only by a girl's touching his shoulder.

Xenophon made open profession of his passionate love to Clineas.

Aristippus, of Cyrene, writ a lewd book of ancient delights; he
compared a woman to a house or a ship, that was the better for being
used: he asserted, that there was no crime in pleasure, but only in
being a slave to it: and often used to say, I enjoy Lais, but Lais
does not enjoy me.

Theodorus openly maintained, that a wise man might, without shame or
scandal, keep company with common harlots.

Plato, our great pattern for chaste love, proposes, as the greatest
reward for public service, that he who has performed a signal
exploit, should not be denied any amorous favour. He writ a
description of the loves of his time, and several amorous sonnets
upon his own minions: his chief favourites were Asterus, Dio,
Phaedrus, and Agatho; but he had, for variety, his female darling
Archeanassa; and was so noted for wantonness, that Antisthenes gave
him the nickname of Satho, i.e. well furnished.

Polemo was prosecuted by his wife for male venery.

Crantor made no secret of his love to his pupil Arcesilaus.

Arcesilaus made love to Demetrius and Leocharus; the last, he said,
he would fain have opened: besides, he openly frequented the two
Elean courtesans, Theodota and Philaeta, and was himself enjoyed by
Demochares and Pythocles: he suffered the last, he said, for
patience' sake.

Bion was noted for debauching his own scholars.

Aristotle, the first Peripatetic, had a son called Nicomacus, by his
concubine Herpilis: he loved her so well, that he left her in his
will a talent of silver, and the choice of his country houses, that,
as he says, the damsel might have no reason to complain: he enjoyed,
besides the eunuch Hermias, others say, only his concubine Pythais,
upon whom he writ a hymn, called, The Infide.

Demetrius Phalereus, who had 360 statues in Athens, kept Lamia for
his concubine, and at the same time was himself enjoyed by Cleo: he
writ a treatise, called, The Lover, and was nicknamed by the
courtesans, Charito Blespharus, i.e. A Charmer of Ladies; and
Lampetes, i.e A Great Boaster of his Abilities.

Diogenes, the Cynic, used to say, that women ought to be in common,
and that marriage was nothing but a man's getting a woman in the
mind to be lain with: he often used manual venery in the public
market-place, with this saying, Oh! I that I [could] assuage my
hunger thus with rubbing of my stomach!

But what wonder if the old Academics, the Cyrenaics and
Peripatetics, were so lewdly wanton, when the very Stoics, who
prided themselves in the conquest of all their other passions, were
forced to submit to this?

Zeno, indeed, the founder of that sect, was remarkable for his
modesty, because he rarely made use of boys, and took but once an
ordinary maid servant to bed, that he might not be thought to hate
the sex; yet, in his commonwealth, he was for a community of women;
and writ a treatise, wherein he regulated the motions in getting a
maidenhead, and philosophically proved action and reaction to be
equal.

Chrysippus and Appollodorus agree with Zeno in a community of women,
and say, that a wise man may be in love with handsome boys.

Erillus, a scholar of Zeno's, was notorious debauchee.

I need not mention the Epicureans that were remarkable for their
obscenity.

Epicurus used to make a pander of his own brother; and his scholar,
the great Metrodorus, visited all the noted courtesans in Athens,
and publicly kept the famous Leontium, his matter's quondam
mistress. Yet, if you will believe Laertius, he was every way a good
man.

But what shall we say of our favourite Seneca, who, with all his
morals, could never acquire the reputation of chastity? He was
indeed somewhat nice in his amours, like the famous Flora, who was
never enjoyed by anything less than a dictator or a consul; for he
scorned to intrigue with anything less than the Empress.

Now, if those reverend schoolmasters, of antiquity, were so loose in
their seminals, shall we, of this age, set up for chastity? Have our
Oxford students more command of their passions than the Stoics? Are
our young Templars less amorous than Plato? Or, is an officer of the
army less ticklish in the shoulder than Socrates?

But I need not waste any rhetoric upon so evident a truth; for plain
and clear propositions, like windows painted, are only the more
obscure the more they are adorned.

I will now suppose, that you have given up the men as incorrigible;
since you are convinced, by experience, that even matrimony is not
able to reclaim them. Marriage, indeed, is just such a cure for
lewdness, as a surfeit is for gluttony; it gives a man's fancy a
distaste to the particular dish, but leaves his palate as luxurious
as ever; for this reason we find so many married men that, like
Sampson's foxes, only do more mischief for having their tails tied.
But the women, you say, are weaker vessels, and you are resolved to
make them submit; rightly judging, if you could make all the females
modest, it would put a considerable stop to fornication. It is great
pity, no doubt, so fine a project should miscarry: and I would
willingly entertain hopes of seeing one of these Bridewell converts.
In the meantime it would not be amiss, if you changed somewhat your
present method of conversion, especially in the article of whipping.
It is very possible, indeed, that leaving a poor girl penniless, may
put her in a way of living honestly, though the want of money was
the only reason of her living otherwise; and the stripping of her
naked, may, for ought I know, contribute to her modesty, and put her
in a state of innocence; but surely, gentlemen you must all know,
that flogging has a quite contrary effect. This project of pulling
down bawdy-houses to prevent uncleanness, puts me in mind of a
certain over-nice gentleman, who could never fancy his garden looked
sweet, till he had demolished a bog-house that offended his eye, in
one corner of it; but it was not long before every nose in the
family was convinced of his mistake. If reason fails to convince,
let us profit by example: observe the policy of a modern butcher,
persecuted with a swarm of carnivorous flies; when all his engines
and fly-traps have proved ineffectual to defend his stall against
the greedy assiduity of those carnal insects, he very judiciously
cuts off a fragment already blown, which serves to hang up for a
cure; and thus, by sacrificing a small part, already tainted, and
not worth keeping, he wisely secures the safety of the rest. Or, let
us go higher for instruction, and take example by the grazier, who
far from denying his herd the accustomed privilege of rubbing, when
their sides are stimulated with sharp humours, very industriously
fixes a stake in the centre of the field; not so much, you may
imagine, to regale the salacious hides of his cattle, as to preserve
his young trees from suffering by the violence of their friction.

I could give you more examples of this kind, equally full of
instruction, but that I'm loth to detain you from the perusal of the
following treatise; and at the same time impatient to have the
honour of subscribing myself

Your fellow-reformer,
and devoted servant

The Preface.
Lest any inquisitive reader should puzzle his brains to find out
why, this foundling is thus clandestinely dropped at his door, let
it suffice him, that the midwife of a printer was unwilling to help
bring it into the world, but upon that condition, or a much harder,
That of I my openly fathering it. I could make many other reasonable
apologies if requisite: For, besides my having followed the modest
example of several other pious authors, such as that of Eikon
Basilike<2>, of the Whole Duty of Man<3>, &c., who have studied
rather their country's public good, than their own private fame. I
think, I have also played the politic part; for should my offspring
be defective, why, let it fall upon the parish: on the other hand,
if accidentally it prove hopeful, 'tis certain I need be at no
farther trouble: there will then be parents enough ready to own the
babe, and take it upon themselves. Adoption amongst the
Machiavellian laws of the Muses, is strictly kept up, and every day
put in practice: how few of our now bright noblemen would otherwise
have wit? How many of our present thriving poets would else want a
dinner? 'Tis a vulgar error to imagine men live upon their own wits,
when generally it is upon others' follies; a fund that carries by
much the best interest, and is by far upon the most certain security
of any: the Exchequer has been shut up, the Bank has stopped
payment, South-Sea has been demolished, but White's was never known
to fail; and indeed how should it, when almost every wind blows to
Dover or Holyhead, some fresh proprietor amply qualified with
sufficient stock.

I am in some pain for the event of this scheme, hoping the wicked
will find it too grave, and fearing the godly will scarce venture
beyond the title-page: and should they even, I know they'll object,
'tis here and there interwoven with too ludicrous expressions, not
considering that a dry argument has occasion for the larding of
gaiety to make it the better relish and go down. Besides, finding by
the exact account tacked to that most edifying Anti-Heidegger<4>
discourse, that eighty-six thousand offenders have been lately
punished, and that four hundred thousand religious books have been
distributed about gratis (not to mention the numberless three-penny
jobs daily published to no ends, or purpose, but the author's); I
say, finding all these measures have been taken, and that lewdness
still so much prevails, thought it highly proper to try this
experiment, being fully convinced that opposite methods often take
place. Own, preferment-hunter! When sailing on with the wind avails
nothing, does not tacking about steer you sometimes into that snug
harbour, an employment? Speak, Hibernian stallion! When a meek
fawning adoration turns to no account, does not a pert assuming
arrogance frequently forward, nay, gain the critical minute? And
say, learned Ward!<5> where a purge fails, is not a vomit an
infallible recipe for a looseness?

To conclude, when my arguments are impartially examined, I doubt not
but my readers will join with me, that as long as it is the nature
of man (and naturam expellas furca licet usque recurret<6>) to have
a salt itch in the breeches, the brimstone under the petticoat will
be a necessary remedy to lay it; and let him be ever so sly in the
,application, it will still be found out: what avails it then to
affect to conceal that which cannot be concealed, and that which if
carried on openly and above board, would become only less
detrimental and of consequence more justifiable.
Be the success of this treatise as it happens, the good of mankind
is my only aim; nor am I less hearty or zealous in the public
welfare of my country, than that noble<7> pattern of sincerity, who
finishes his preface with the following paragraph:

and now, O my G-d, the G-d of my life, and of all my mercies,
I offer this work to thee, to whole honour it is chiefly
intended; that thereby I may awaken the world to just
reflections on their own errors and follies, and call on them
to acknowledge thy providence, to adore it, and ever to depend
on it.



A Modest Defence, &c.

There is nothing more idle, or shows a greater affectation of wit,
than the modern custom of treating the most grave subjects with
burlesque and ridicule. The present subject of whoring, was I
disposed, would furnish me sufficiently in this kind, and might
possibly, if so handled, excite mirth in those who are only capable
of such low impressions. But, as the chief design of this treatise
is to promote the general welfare and happiness of mankind, I hope
to be excused, if I make no farther attempts to please, than are
consistent with that design. The practice of whoring has, of late
years, become so universal, and its effects so prejudicial to
mankind, that several attempts have been made to put a stop to it;
and a certain society of worthy gentlemen have undertaken that
affair with a zeal truly commendable, though the success does but
too plainly make it appear, that they were mistaken in their
measures, and had not rightly considered the nature of this evil,
which we are all equally solicitous to prevent, however we may
differ in our opinions as to the manner. And though the method I
intend to propose, of erecting public stews for that purpose, may
seem at first sight somewhat ludicrous, I shall, nevertheless, make
it appear to be the only means we have now left for redressing this
grievance. As this redress is the whole scope and design of this
treatise, I hope to be acquitted of my design, when I have proved
the following proposition; that public whoring is neither so
criminal in itself, nor so detrimental to the society, as private
whoring; and that the encouraging of public whoring, by erecting
stews, will not only prevent most of the ill consequences of this
vice, but even lessen the quantity of whoring in general, and reduce
it to the narrowest bounds which it can possibly be contained in.
But before we proceed, it is requisite that we examine what those
mischievous effects are which whoring naturally produces, that we
may the better judge whether or no they will be prevented by this
scheme.

The greatest evil that attends this vice, or could well befall
mankind, is the propagation of that infectious disease, called the
French pox<8>, which, in two centuries, has made such incredible
havoc all over Europe. In these kingdoms it so seldom fails to
attend whoring, nowadays mistaken for gallantry and politeness, that
a hale, robust constitution is esteemed a mark of ungentility; and a
healthy young fellow is looked upon with the same view, as if he had
spent his life in a cottage. Our gentlemen of the army, whose
unsettled way of life makes it inconvenient for them to marry, are
hereby very much weakened and enervated, and rendered unfit to
undergo such hardships as are necessary for defending and supporting
the honour of their country: and our gentry in general seem to
distinguish themselves by an ill state of health, in all probability
the effect of this pernicious distemper: for the secrecy which most
people are obliged to in this disease, makes the cure of it often
ineffectual; and though the infection itself may possibly be
removed, yet for want of taking proper methods, it generally leaves
such an ill habit of body as is not easily recovered. 'Tis to this
we seem to owe the rise of that distemper, the King's-evil<9>, never
known till the French disease began to prevail here. But what makes
this mischief the more intolerable, is that the innocent must suffer
by it as well as the guilty: men give it to their wives, women to
their husbands, or perhaps their children; they to their nurses, and
the nurses again to other children; so that no age, sex, or
condition can be entirely safe from the infection.

Another ill effect of this vice, is, its making people profuse, and
tempting them to live beyond what their circumstances will admit of;
for if once men suffer their minds to be led astray by this unruly
passion, no worldly consideration whatever will be able to stop it;
and wenching as it is very expensive in itself, without the ordinary
charges of physic or children, often leads men into a thousand other
vices to support its extravagance: besides, after the mind has once
got this extravagant turn, there naturally follows a neglect and
contempt of business; and whoring of itself disposes the mind to
such a sort of indolence, as is quite inconsistent with industry,
the main support of any, especially a trading, nation.

The murdering of bastard infants is another consequence of this
vice, by much worse than the vice itself: and though the law is
justly severe in this particular, as rightly judging that a mind
capable of divesting itself so entirely of humanity, is not fit to
live in a civilized nation; yet there are so many ways of evading
it, either by destroying the infants before their birth, or
suffering them afterwards to die by wilful neglect, that there
appears but little hope of putting any stop to this practice, which,
besides the barbarity of it, tends very much to dispeople the
country. And since the prosperity of any country is allowed to
depend, in a great measure, on the number of its inhabitants, the
government ought, if it were possible, to prevent any whoring at
all, as it evidently hinders the propagation of the species: how
many thousand young men in this nation would turn their thoughts
towards matrimony, if they were not constantly destroying that
passion, which is the only foundation of it? And though most of
them, sooner or later, find the inconvenience of this irregular
life, and think fit to confine themselves to one, yet their bodies
are so much enervated, by the untimely or immoderate increase of
this passion, together with the relics of venereal cures, that they
beget a most wretched, feeble, and sickly offspring: we can
attribute it to nothing else but this, that so many of our ancient
families of nobles are of late extinct.

There is one thing more we ought to consider in this vice, and that
is the injury it does to particular persons and families either by
alienating the affections of wives from their husbands, which often
proves prejudicial to both, and sometimes fatal to whole families;
or else by debauching the minds of young women, to their utter ruin
and destruction: for the reproach they must undergo, when a slip of
this nature is discovered, prevents their marrying in any degree
suitable to their fortune, and by degrees hardens them to all sense
of shame; and when they have once overcome that, the present view of 
interest as well as pleasure, sways them to continue in the same
course, till at length they become common prostitutes.

These are the several bad effects of whoring; and it is an unhappy
thing, that a practice so universal as this is, and always will be,
should be attended with such mischievous consequences: but since few
or none of them are the necessary effects of whoring, considered in
itself, but only proceed from the abuse and ill management of it;
our business is certainly to regulate this affair in such sort as
may best prevent these mischiefs. And I must here beg pardon of
those worthy gentlemen of the society, if I can't conceive how the
discouragement they have given, or rather attempted to give, to
public whoring, could possibly have the desired effect. If this was
a vice acquired by habit or custom, or depended upon education, as
most other vices, there might be some hopes of suppressing it; and
then it would, no doubt, be commendable to attack it, without
distinction, in whatever form or disguise it should appear: but
alas! This violent love for women is born and bred with us; nay, it
is absolutely necessary to our being born at all: and however some
people may pretend, that unlawful enjoyment is contrary to the law
of nature; this is certain, that nature never fails to furnish us
largely with this passion, though she is often sparing to bestow
upon us such a portion of reason and reflection as is necessary to
curb it.

That long course of experience which most of these gentlemen have
had in the world, and which is of so great use in other cases, may
probably occasion their mistake in this; for age is very liable to
forget the violence of youthful passions, and, consequently, apt to
think them easier curbed: whereas if we consider the true source of
whoring, and the strong impulse of nature that way, we shall find,
it is a thing not to be too violently restrained; lest, like a
stream diverted out of its proper channel, it should break in and
overflow the neighbouring enclosures.

History affords us several instances of this truth; I shall mention
but one, and that is of Pope Sixtus the 5th, who was so strictly
severe in the execution of justice, if such severity may be called
justice, and particularly, against offenders of this kind, that he
condemned a young man to the galleys, only for snatching a kiss of a
damsel in the street: yet notwithstanding this his holiness's zeal,
he never attempted once to extirpate whoring entirely: but like a
true pastor separated the clean sheep from the unclean, and confined
all the courtesans to one quarter of the city. It is true, he did
attempt to moderate this vice, and banished as many courtesans as he
thought exceeded the necessary number; but he was soon convinced of
the error of his computation, for sodomy and a thousand other
unnatural vices sprung up, which forced him soon to recall them, and
has left us a remarkable instance of the vanity of such attempts.

Let us now proceed to the proof of our proposition, in the first
part of which, it was asserted, that public whoring is neither so
criminal in itself, nor so detrimental to the society, as private
whoring.

Public whoring consists in lying with a certain set of women, who
have shook off all pretence to modesty; and for such a sum of money,
more or less, profess themselves always in a readiness to be
enjoyed. The mischief a man does in this case is entirely to
himself, for with respect to the woman, he does a laudable action,
in furnishing her with the means of subsistence, in the only, or at
least most innocent way that she is capable of procuring of it. The
damage he does to himself, is either with regard to his health, or
the expense of money, and may be considered under the same view as
drinking, with this considerable advantage, that it restores us to
that cool exercise of our reason, which drinking tends to deprive us
of. Indeed was there a probability of a woman's amendment, and of 
her gaining a livelihood by some honester method, there might be
some crime in encouraging her to follow such a profession: but the
minds of women are observed to be so much corrupted by the loss of
chastity, or rather by the reproach they suffer upon that loss, that
they seldom or never change that course of life for the better; and
if they should, they can never recover that good name, which is so
absolutely necessary to their getting a maintenance in any honest
way whatever; and that nothing but mere necessity obliges them to
continue in that course, is plain from this, that they themselves in
reality utterly abhor it: and indeed there appears nothing in it so
very alluring and bewitching, especially to people who have that
inclination to lewdness entirely extinguished, which is the only
thing could possibly make it supportable.

The other branch of whoring, viz. Private, is of much worse
consequence; and a man's crime in this case, increases in proportion
to the different degree of mischief done, if you consider his crime
with regard to the society; for as to personal guilt, allowance
ought to be made for the increase of temptation, which is very
considerable in the case of debauching married women; upon account
of the safety to the aggressor, either with respect to his health,
or the charge, and, if that affects him, the scandal of having a
bastard. On the other hand, the injury done, is very considerable,
as such an action tends to corrupt a woman's mind, and destroys that
mutual love and affection between man and wife, which is so
necessary to both their happiness. Besides, the risk run of a
discovery, which at least ruins a woman's reputation, and destroys
the husband's quiet; nay, where virtue does not entirely give way,
if it warps but ever so little, the consequence is shockingly fatal:
for though the good man, suspicious of the wife's chastity, the wife
of the gallant's constancy, and the gallant of the husband's
watchfulness, by being a check upon each other, may keep the gate of
virtue shut; yet then even all parties must be attended with a
never-ceasing misery, not to be imagined, but by those who too
fatally feel it.

The crime of debauching young virgins will appear much greater, if
we consider that there is much more mischief done, and the
temptation to do it much lessened by the fear of getting children;
which, in most circumstances of life, does a man a deal of
prejudice, and keeps at least three parts in four of our sober youth
from gratifying this violent passion. Besides, the methods that are
necessary to be taken, before a man can have such an action in his
power, are in themselves criminal; and it shows a certain baseness
of mind to persuade a woman, by a thousand solemn vows and
protestations, into such a good opinion of you, and assurance of
your love to her, that she trusts you with all that is dear and near
to her; and this with no other view but the gratification of a
present passion, which might be otherwise vented, than at the
certain expense of her ruin, and putting her under the necessity of
leading the life of a public courtesan.

From this general consideration of whoring, it is evident, that
though all the several species of it proceed from the same cause,
our natural love and passion for women, yet they are very different
in their natures, and fully as distinct crimes as those which
proceed from our love to money, such as murder, shoplifting, &c. And
I hope I have said enough to prove, that the public part of it is by
far the least criminal, and least detrimental to the society; which
of itself is a sufficient motive for the legislature to confine it
to that channel. I shall now proceed farther, and show, as I before
proposed, that the encouraging of public whoring, will not only
prevent most of the mischievous effects of this vice, but even
lessen the quantity of whoring in general, and reduce it to the
narrowest bounds which it can possibly be contained in.

When I talked of encouraging public whoring, I would be understood
to mean, not only the erecting public stews, as I at first hinted,
but also the endowing them with such privileges and immunities, and
at the same time giving such discouragement to private whoring, as
may be most effectual to turn the general stream of lewdness into
this common channel.

I shall here lay down a plan for this purpose, which, though it may
well serve to illustrate this point, and make good the proof of my
present argument, would doubtless receive infinite improvement by
coming through the hands of a national senate, whose august body,
being composed of spirituals as well as temporals, will, I hope,
take into consideration this important affair, which so nearly
concerns both.

The plan I would propose, is this: let a hundred or more houses be
provided in some convenient quarter of the city, and proportionably
in every country town, sufficient to contain two thousand women: if
a hundred are thought sufficient, let a hundred matrons be
appointed, one to each house, of abilities and experience enough to
take upon them the management of twenty courtesans each, to see that
they keep themselves neat and decent, and entertain gentlemen after
a civil and obliging manner. For the encouragement of such matrons,
each house must be allowed a certain quantity of all sorts of
liquor, custom and excise free; by which means they will be enabled
to accommodate gentlemen handsomely, without that imposition so
frequently met with in such houses. Besides the hundred
abovementioned, there must be a very large house set apart for an
infirmary, and provision made for two able physicians, and four
surgeons at least. Lastly, there must be three commissioners
appointed to superintend the whole, to hear and redress complaints,
and to see that each house punctually observes such rules and orders
as shall be thought necessary for the good government of this
community. For the better entertainment of all ranks and degrees of
gentlemen, we shall divide the twenty women of each house into four
classes, who for their beauty, or other qualifications may justly
charge different prices.

The first class is to consist of eight, who may legally demand from
each visitant half a crown. The second class to consist of six,
whose fixed price may be a crown. The third class of four, at half a
guinea each. The remaining two make up the fourth class, and are
designed for persons of the first rank, who can afford to pay a
guinea for the elegancy of their taste. To defray the charges of
this establishment, will require but a very moderate tax: for if the
first class pays but forty shillings yearly, and the rest in
proportion, it will amount to above ten thousand pounds a year,
which will not only pay the commissioners' salaries, surgeons'
chests, and other contingencies, but likewise establish a good fund
for the maintenance of bastard-orphans and superannuated courtesans.

For the better government of this society, it will be necessary that
the mistress have an absolute command in her own house, and that no
woman be suffered to go abroad without her leave. No woman must be
suffered to lie in within the house, nor any young children admitted
under any pretence. No music or revelling to be allowed in any room,
to the disturbance of the rest. No gentlemen disorderly or drunk, to
be admitted at an unseasonable hour, without the consent of the
mistress: and, in case of violence, she must be empowered to call
the civil aid.

For the society's security in point of health, it must be ordered,
that if any gentleman complains of receiving an injury, and the
woman, upon search, be found tainted, without having discovered it
to the mistress, she shall be stripped and cashiered. But if a woman
discovers her misfortune before any complaint is made against her,
she shall be sent to the infirmary, and cured at the public charge.
No woman that has been twice poxed shall ever be re-admitted. Note,
that three claps shall be reckoned equivalent to one pox.

But as no society ever framed a complete body of laws at once, till
unforeseen accidents had taught them foresight, we shall refer the
farther regulation of these laws, with whatever new ones shall be
thought necessary, to the wisdom of the legislature.

The public stews being thus erected and governed by good and
wholesome laws, there remains nothing to complete this project, but
that proper measures be taken effectually to discourage all other
kinds of whoring whatsoever. And here it is to be hoped, that those
worthy gentlemen of the society who have hitherto distinguished
their zeal to so little purpose, will now exert themselves where
they have so good a prospect of success; for although a poor
itinerant courtesan could not by any means be persuaded to starve at
the instigation of a reforming constable, yet a little Bridewell
rhetoric, or the terrors of a transportation, will soon convince her
that she may live more comfortably and honestly in a public stew. If
there are any so foolish as to love rambling better, or who are not
qualified to please gentlemen according to law, they ought to be
transported; for Bridewell, as it is now managed, only makes them
poorer, and consequently lays them under a greater necessity than
ever of continuing whores.

Let us now suppose, for brevity's sake, that the public stews are as
much as possible favoured and encouraged, and that all the other
branches of this vice have the utmost rigour of the laws exerted
against them.

It now remains for me to show what benefit the nation would receive
thereby, and how this project would prevent or in any degree
alleviate those mischiefs which I have mentioned to be the necessary
consequences of this vice. As for any objections that may be raised
against me, either Christian or moral, I shall refer them to the
close of this discourse.

First, then, I say, the nation would receive a general benefit by
having such a considerable number of its most disorderly inhabitants
brought to live after a regular civilized manner. There is, one year
with another, a certain number of young women who arrive gradually,
step by step, at the highest degree of impudence and lewdness. These
women, besides their incontinence, are commonly guilty of almost the
whole catalogue of immoral actions: the reason is evident: they are
utterly abandoned by their parents, and thereby reduced to the last
degree of shifting poverty; if their lewdness cannot supply their
wants, they must have recourse to methods more criminal, such as
lying, cheating, open theft, &c. Not that these are the necessary
concomitants of lewdness, or have the least relation to it, as all 
lewd men of honour can testify; but the treatment such women meet
with in the world, is the occasion of it.

Those females, who either by the frigidity of their constitutions, a
lucky want of temptation, or any other cause, have preserved their
chastity; and the men, in general, chaste or unchaste, are so
outrageous against these delinquents, that they make no distinction:
all of them are branded with the same opprobrious title, they are
all treated with the same contempt, all equally despised; so that
let them be guilty of what other crimes they please, they cannot add
one jot to the shame they already undergo. Having thus removed the
fear of worldly reproach, which is justly esteemed the greatest
bulwark of morality, it is no wonder if these women, insensible of
shame, and pricked on by want, commit any crimes, where they are not
deterred by the fear of corporal punishments. But the case now will
be quite altered; these women, as soon as they have attained a
competent share of assurance, and before they are pinched with the
extreme of poverty, will enter themselves in some of the above-
mentioned classes of professed courtesans; where, instead of being
necessarily dishonest, they will have more inducements to honesty
than any other profession whatsoever. The same money defends, as
well as it corrupts a prime minister: a churchman takes sanctuary in
a gown, and who dare accuse a mitre of simony? Accuse a colonel of
injustice, he is tried by his board of peers, and your information
is false, scandalous, and malicious. A lawyer cheats you according
to law; and you may thank the physician, if you live to complain of
him. Overreaching in trade, is prudent dealing; and mechanic
cunning, is styled handicraft. Not so fares the poor courtesan; if
she commits but one ill action, if for instance, she should
circumvent a gentleman in a snuff-box, she can hardly escape
detection; and the first discovery ruins her; she is banished the
public stews, marked out for infamy; and can have no better prospect
than a transportation. On the other hand, the motives to honesty
will be as great here as anywhere: it is natural for mankind to
regard chiefly the good opinion of those with whom they converse,
and to neglect that of strangers; now in this community, lewdness
not being esteemed a reproach, but rather a commendation, they will
set a value on their good name, and stand as much upon the puncto of
honour, as the rest of mankind; being moved by the same commendable
emulation, and deterred by greater, or at least more certain
punishments. Besides this reformation in point of honesty, the
public will receive another benefit in being freed from those
nocturnal disorders, quarrels, and brawlings, which are occasioned
by vagrant punks, and the number of private brothels dispersed
throughout the city, to the great disturbance of its sober
inhabitants.

We have already mentioned the French disease as one of the worst
attendants upon lewdness, and with good reason; for in the enjoyment
of this life, health is the sine qua non: and this distemper has one
thing in it peculiarly inveterate, as if it came out of Pandora's
worst box: there is no other disorder, but what at some age, or in
some particular constitution, will abate of itself without the
application of medicines; but this is such a busy restless enemy,
that unless resisted, he is never at a stand, but gathers strength
every day, to the utter disquiet of the patient. Now it is so
evident that the public stews, when well regulated, will prevent the
spreading of this plague, that a prolix and tedious proof of it
would look like declaiming. As this disease has its spring and
source entirely from public whoring, and from thence creeps into
private families; so it likewise receives continual supplies and
recruits through the same channel: when this source is once dried
up, the nation will naturally recover its pristine health and
vigour: and this cannot fail to happen, if due care be taken to keep
the stews free from infection; for what young fellow will be so
industriously mad, as to take pains to run his head into an
apothecary's shop, when he may with so much ease and convenience,
and without the fear of a reforming officer, both secure his health,
and gratify his fancy with such a variety of mistresses.

'Tis true, the keeping of the public stews so very safe will appear
a difficult task, at first sight, but not so if we consider the case
a little nearer. This disease is propagated reciprocally from the
woman to the man, and from the man to the woman; but the first is
the most common for several reasons: we are not like cocks or town-
bulls; who have a whole seraglio of females entirely and solely at
their devotion; on the contrary, one industrious painstaking woman,
that lays herself out that way, is capable of satisfying several
rampant males; insomuch, that a select number of women get a
handsome livelihood by being able to oblige such a number of
customers. Now, if but a few of these women are unsound, they can
infect a great many men; whereas these men have neither power nor
inclination to infect the like number of women. I say, inclination;
for a woman, to raise money for the surgeon's fee, may counterfeit
pleasure when she really receives pain; nay, she may even venture to
complain of being hurt: for the man will attribute the pain he gives
her, either to her chastity, or his own vigour; not dreaming,
perhaps, that he has molested a chancre<10>. This a female may do,
as being only passive in the affair, but a man must have real fancy
and inclination before he is qualified to enter upon action: and how
far this fancy to woman may be cooled by a stinging gonorrhæa, I
leave the experienced reader to judge; and whether a man won't
rather employ his thoughts upon his round diet<11>, how to digest
two at night, and three in the morning; what conveyance to find out,
when poached eggs grow nauseous, and how to preserve his linen from
being speckled; with a thousand other particulars that occur to a
man in this distress: but these are sufficient, with the assistance
of a chordee<12>, to bridle any moderate passion. So that from the
whole we may safely draw this conclusion; that since the men are so
seldom guilty of transgressing in this kind, the spreading of this
distemper must be owing to the neglect of cure in the women. Now the
public stews will be so regulated, that a woman cannot possibly
conceal her misfortune long; nay, it will be highly her interest to
make the first discovery: so that whatever damage the society may
sustain at first, when claps are most current, it will be soon
repaired, and this distemper, in time, entirely rooted out. But of
this enough.

The next thing that comes to be considered in this vice, is the
expense it occasions, and the neglect of worldly business, by
employing so much of our time and thoughts; for let a man have ever
so much business, it can't stop the circulation of his blood, or
prevent the seminal secretion: for sleeping or waking, the
spermatics will do their office, though a man's thoughts may be so
much employed about other affairs, that he cannot attend to every
minute titillation. A man of pleasure, indeed, may make this
copulative science his whole study; and, by idleness and luxury, may
prompt nature that way, and spur up the spirits to wantonness: but
then his constitution will be the sooner tired; for the animal
spirits being exhausted by this anticipation, his body must be
weakened, and his nerves relaxed; neither will his irregular
effeminate life assist them in recovering their former force.
Besides, those parts which more particularly suffer the violence of
this exercise, are liable to many accidents; and men of pleasure,
though otherwise pretty healthy, are often troubled with gleets<13>
and weaknesses, either by a former ulceration of the prostates, or
else some violent over-straining, which occasions this relaxation.
These men, 'tis true, will talk very lusciously of women, but,
pretend what they please, they can never have that burning desire
which they had formerly, when their vessels were in full vigour. The
truth is, their lust lies chiefly in their brain, kept alive by the
impression of former ideas, which are not so easily rubbed out as
the titillation which created them; and this passion comes to be so
diminished, that, in time, it changes its residence from the glans
penis to the glandula penealis.<14> A man of business, on the
contrary, or one who leads a sober regular life, will seldomer be
attacked by these wanton fits, but then they will come with double
the violence; for though it is a common received opinion, that the
longer a man refrains, the better he is able to refrain, yet it is
only true in one sense, and amounts to no more than this: that if a
man has been able, for such and such reasons, to curb this passion,
for instance, a month, he will, if the same reasons hold, and
without an additional temptation, be able to curb it a month longer;
but, nevertheless, he may have desires much stronger than a man who,
for want of these motives to abstinence, gratifies them every day.
If there are some men of a particular constitution, whose puny
desires may be easily blocked up with the assistance of three small
buttons; or else endowed with such an extraordinary strength of
reason, that they can master the most rampant sallies of this raging
passion; I heartily congratulate their happy conquest, but have
nothing more to do with them at present, the public stews not being
designed for such: I am here speaking of those men of business, who,
notwithstanding their abstinence or the regularity of their lives,
are sometimes prevailed upon to quench these amorous heats; and, I
say, in such men the passion is much stronger than in men of
pleasure, and that their abstinence contributes to heighten the
violence of the desire, and make it the more irresistible: for the
fancy not being cloyed with too frequent enjoyment, presently takes
fire; and the spermatics, not being weakened with forced
evacuations, are in their full vigour, and give the nerves a most
exquisite sensation: so that upon the least toying with an alluring
wench, the blood vessels are ready to start; and to use Othello's
words, The very sense aches at her.<15>

Now what shall this man do, when he has once taken the resolution to
make himself easy? He must either venture upon the public, where, it
is odds, he may meet with a mischance that will either drain his
pocket, and make him unfit for any business, at least without doors;
or else he must employ both his time and rhetoric, and perhaps too
his purse, in deluding some modest girl; which, besides the loss of
time in carrying on such an intrigue, is apt to give the head such
an amorous turn as is quite inconsistent with business, and may
probably lead a man into after-expenses, which at first he never
dreamed of.

Now, to remedy all these inconveniencies, the public stews will be
always ready and open, where a man may regulate his expenses
according to his ability, from half a crown to a guinea; and that
too without endangering his health: and besides, which is chiefly to
be considered, if a man should be overtaken with a sudden gust of
lechery, it will be no hindrance to him even in the greatest hurry
of business, for a ready and willing mistress will ease him in the
twinkling of an eye, and he may prosecute his affairs with more
attention than ever, by having his mind entirely freed and
disengaged from those troublesome ideas which always accompany a
wanton disposition of the body. But to proceed:

Another ill consequence of whoring, is the tendency it has to
dispeople a nation; and that both by the destruction of bastard
infants, and by ruining young men's constitutions so much, that,
when they marry, they either beget no children, or such as are
sickly and short-lived. The first of these, indeed, is almost
unavoidable, especially in modest women, who will be guilty of this
cruelty as long as female chastity carries that high reputation
along with it, which it really deserves: however, in common women,
it may and will be, in a great measure, prevented by this scheme;
for every professed courtesan, that is legally licensed, will have
an apartment allotted her in the infirmary when she is ready to lie
in, and will be obliged to take care of her child; by which means a
considerable number of infants will be reared up, that otherwise
might probably have perished. Besides, there are a great many
ordinary girls, such as servant-maids, who are chiefly moved to this
action, by the fear of losing their services, and wanting bread. Now
this handsome provision that is made for them, will be a great
inducement for such to enter themselves in the stews, rather than
commit such an unnatural action, especially when the discovery is
death.

Let us now consider the affair of matrimony. Since the world is now
no longer in a state of nature, but formed into several societies
independent of one another, and these societies again divided into
several ranks and degrees of men, distinguished by their titles and
possessions, which descend from father to son; it is very certain
that marriage is absolutely necessary, not only for the regular
propagation of the species, and their careful education, but
likewise for preserving that distinction of rank among mankind,
which otherwise would be utterly lost and confounded by doubtful
successions. And it is no less certain and indisputable, that all
sorts and kinds of debauchery whatever are enemies to this state, in
so far as they impair the natural vigour of the constitution, and
weaken the very springs of love.

 This necessary passion is, indeed, of such a ticklish nature, that
either too much or too little of it is equally prejudicial, and the
medium is so hard to hit, that we are apt to fall into one of the 
extremes. We are naturally furnished with an extraordinary stock of
love; and, by the largeness of the provision, it looks as if nature
had made some allowance for wear and tear. If young men were to live
entirely chaste and sober, without blunting the edge of their
passions, the first fit of love would turn their brains topsy-turvy,
and we should have the nation pestered with love adventures and
feats of chivalry: by the time a peer's son came to be sixteen, he
would be in danger of turning knight-errant, and might possibly take
a cobbler's daughter for his Dulcinea<16>; and who knows but a
sprightly young tailor might turn an Orlando Furioso<17>, and
venture his neck to carry off a lady of birth and fortune. In short,
there are so many instances every day of these ruinous
disproportioned matches, notwithstanding our present intemperance,
that we may justly conclude, if the nation was in a state of perfect
sobriety, no man could answer for the conduct of his children.

It must, indeed, be confessed, as matters now stand, the excess of
chastity is not so much to be feared as the other extreme of
lewdness, though there are instances of both; and many fathers, now
living, would gladly have seen their sons fifty times in a stew,
rather than see them so unfortunately married. The other extreme is
equally, or rather more dangerous, as it is more common; for most
young men give too great a loose to their passions, and either quite
destroy their inclination to matrimony, or make their constitutions
incapable of answering the ends of that state.

To avoid therefore these two dangerous extremes, we have erected the
public stews, which every considerate man must allow to be that
golden mean so much desired: for, in the first place, we avoid the
inconvenience of too strict a chastity. When a man has gained some
experience by his commerce in the stews, he is able to form a pretty
good comparative judgment of what he may expect from the highest
gratifications of love; he finds his ideas of beauty strangely
altered after enjoyment, and will not be hurried into an unsuitable
match by those romantic chimerical notions of love, which possess
the minds of unexperienced youth, and make them fancy that love
alone can complete the happiness of a married state. But this will
be so readily granted, that I shan't insist upon it farther.

In the next place, the public stews will prevent the ill effects of
excessive lewdness, by preserving men's constitutions so well, that
though they may defer matrimony some time for special advantage, yet
they will have a sufficient stock of desire left to persuade them,
one time or other, to quit the gaiety of a single life: and when
they do marry, they will be able to answer all the ends and purposes
of that state as well, and rather better, than if they had lived
perfectly chaste.

This may seem a bold proposition, but the proof of it is
nevertheless obvious. However, to proceed methodically, there are
three ways by which lewd young men destroy their natural vigour, and
render themselves impotent: first, by manufriction, alias
masturbation. Secondly, by too frequent and immoderate enjoyment.
And, lastly, by contracting venereal disorders, as claps or poxes.

The first lewd trick that boys learn, is this manual diversion; and
when they have once got the knack of it, they seldom quit it till
they come to have actual commerce with women: the safety, privacy,
convenience, and cheapness of this gratification are very strong
motives, and chiefly persuade young men to continue the practice of
it.

If these Onanites were so abstemious as to wait the ordinary calls
of nature, this action, however unnatural, would be no more
prejudicial, when prudently managed, than common copulation; but,
instead of this, they are every day committing rapes upon their own
bodies; and though they have neither real inclination nor ability to
attack a woman, yet they can attack themselves, and supply all these
defects by the agility of their wrists; by which means they so
weaken their genitals, and accustom them to this violent friction,
that, though they have frequently evacuations without an erection,
yet the common and ordinary sensation which females afford to those
parts, is not able of itself to promote this evacuation: so that
they are impotent to all intents and purposes of generation.

To put a stop therefore to these clandestine practices, and prevent
young men from laying violent hands upon themselves, we must have
recourse to the public stews, which cannot fail to have the desired
effect: for which of these private practitioners can be so brutish,
as to prefer this boyish, solitary amusement before the actual
embraces of a fine woman, when they can proceed with the same
convenience, safety, and privacy in the one, as well as the other.

In the next place, men are often weakened, and sometimes contract
almost incurable gleets<13> by too frequent and immoderate
enjoyment. This seldom or never happens but in private whoring, when
some particular mistress has made such a strong impression upon a
man's fancy, that he exerts himself in an extraordinary manner
beyond his natural ability, and thereby contracts a seminal
weakness, which is generally more difficult to cure than a virulent
running. Now this danger will be pretty well removed by the
encouragement given to public whoring, which, as I shall show more
particularly hereafter, will divert men's minds, and turn their
thoughts very much from private intrigues: and it will be readily
granted me, that no such excess is to be feared in public stews;
where a man only acting out of a general principle of love to the
whole sex, will be in no danger of proceeding any farther than he is
prompted by nature, and the particular disposition of his body at
that time.

As for the third cause of impotency, the venereal disease, we have
already proved that this institution of the stews is the best and
surest remedy against it; and shall only observe here how happily
this project provides against the various ill effects of lewdness,
in whatever light we consider them.

Thus, I think, the first part of my proposition pretty well cleared,
viz. That the public stews will preserve men's constitutions so
well, that they will have a sufficient stock of corporal ability,
and consequently inclination left to persuade them, sooner or later,
to enter into the marriage-state.

I say farther, that these men, having thus preserved their
constitution, will answer all the intents and purposes of that
state, rather better than if they had lived perfectly chaste.

When a man and a woman select one another out of the whole species,
it is not merely for propagation; nay, that is generally the least
in their thoughts: what they chiefly have in view, is to pass the
remainder of their lives happily together, to enjoy the soft
embraces and mutual endearments of love; to divide their joys and
griefs; to share their pleasures and afflictions; and, in short, to
make one another as happy as possible. As for children, they come of
course, and of course are educated according to their parents'
abilities.

Now all these enjoyments depending upon the mutual affection of
these two, man and wife; whenever this affection fails, either in
the woman or the man, that marriage is unhappy, and all the good
ends and designs of this state entirely frustrated. To give the
women their due, they must have the preference in point of
constancy; their passions are not so easily raised, nor so suddenly
fixed upon any particular object: but when this passion is once
rooted in women, it is much stronger and more durable than in men,
and rather increases than diminishes, by enjoying the person
beloved. Whether it is that women receive as much love as they part
with, and that the love they receive is not entirely lost, but takes
root again by conception; whereas what a man parts with never
affects him farther, than just the pleasure he receives at the time
of parting with it; or whether this difference is owing to the
different turn of men's fancies, which are more susceptible of fresh
impressions from every handsome face they meet, or perhaps that
their heads are so much employed in worldly affairs, that they only
take love en passant to get rid of a present uneasiness, whereas
women make it the whole business of their lives: whatever the reason
is, I say, it is experimentally true, that a woman has but a very
slippery hold of a man's affections after enjoyment. Let us see
therefore which of these two, the chaste or the experienced man,
will be least liable to this failure of affection, and consequently
which of the two will make the best married man.

The first great cooler of a man's affections after marriage, is the
disparity of the match. When a man has married entirely for love,
and to the apparent detriment of his worldly affairs, as soon as the
first flush of it is over, he can't help reflecting upon the woman
as the cause, and, in some sense, the author of his misfortunes:
this naturally begets a coldness and indifference, which, by
degrees, turns to an open dislike. Now it is these sort of marriages
that chaste men are always in danger of falling into, as I have
already proved; neither is there any effectual way to convince a man
of this folly, and secure him against it, but by giving him some
experience in love-affairs. Again, as chaste men seldom marry for
anything but sheer love, so they have framed to themselves such high
extravagant notions of the raptures they expect to possess in the
marriage-bed, that they are mightily shocked at the disappointment.
A chaste unexperienced man is strangely surprised, that those
bewitching charms should make such a faint impression upon him after
a thorough perusal; he can scarce believe that the woman is still
possessed of the same charms which transported him formerly; he
fancies he has discovered abundance of little faults and
imperfections, and attributes his growing dislike to this discovery,
not dreaming that this alteration is entirely in himself, and not in
the object of desire, which remains still the same. The truth is,
when a man is full fraught with love, and that his pulse beats high
for enjoyment, this peccant love-humour falls down upon the eye,
which may be observed at such a time to be full brisk and sparkling:
'tis then the beauty of every feature is magnified by coming through
this false perspective. And Parthenope<18> is no less than a
goddess. But when this dazzling humour is drawn downwards by a
revulsion, as in the case of marriage, a man's eyes are perfectly
opened; and though they may look languid, sunk, and environed with
blueish circles, yet he actually sees much better than before; for
Parthenope will now appear to him a mortal, such as she really is,
divested of all those false glosses and appearances.

The chaste man is surprised at this change; he is apt to lay the
fault upon the woman, and generally fixes his affections on some
other female, who, he imagines, is free from those faults: then
farewell happy wedlock. The experienced man, on the contrary, has
tried several women; he finds they all agree in one particular, and
that after a storm of love there always succeeds a calm: when he
enters into matrimony, he is prepared against any disappointments of
that nature, and is ready to make allowance for those faults and
imperfections which are inseparable from human kind.

This is so true, that women have established a maxim, that rakes
make the best husbands; for they are very sensible how difficult it
is to monopolize a man's affections; that he will have his curiosity
about those affairs satisfied one time or other: and though this
experience is useful before marriage, it is very dangerous
afterwards.

Besides, to complete the happiness of the marriage state, or indeed
to make it tolerably easy, there must be some agreement in the
temper, humour, and disposition of the two parties concerned. If,
for instance, the man can't endure the sight of a metropolis, and
the woman can't enjoy herself out of it; if the man is grave,
serious, and an enemy to all jocular merriment, when his wife is a
professed lover of mirth and gaiety, these two can never agree;
differences will arise every day, and differences in wedlock are as
hard to reconcile as those in religion: we may guess at the reason
from a parallel instance.

After the revocation of the Edict of Nantes<19>, several Protestant
gentlemen were shut up in the Bastille at Paris, where they lived
constantly together for a considerable time: they made an
observation, during their stay there, that whenever the least 
difference or dispute happened amongst them, it was never reconciled
till some time after their enlargement; because, said they, although
we were yoke-fellows in affliction, yet never being out of one
another's company, our animosities were always kept up warm, for
want of a little absence to cool them. It is the same case with
matrimony; and people ought to be particularly careful to choose a
wife as nearly of their own temper as possible.

Now this consideration never enters into the head of a chaste
unexperienced man; he is so infatuated with personal love, that he
imagines his whole future happiness depends upon the possession of
such a shape, or such a composition of features; when he is
disappointed in this, how much will it add to his chagrin, to find
himself yoked for life to a woman whose temper is quite opposite to
his own, and consequently whose satisfaction is quite inconsistent
with his? We may guess the sequel; separate beds, separate
maintenance, and all the whole train of conjugal misfortunes. In
short, let us consider matrimony under what view we please, we shall
still find that the experienced man will make the best husband, and
answer all the ends of marriage much better than a man who lives
perfectly chaste to his wedding-day.

Thus, we see, by this happy regulation of the public stews, that
whoring, instead of being an enemy to matrimony, will advance and
promote the interest of it as much as possible.

We come now to the last great point proposed, viz. That this project
of the public stews will prevent, as much as possible, the
debauching of modest women, and thereby reduce whoring to the
narrowest bounds in which it can possibly be contained.

To illustrate this matter, we must step a little back to consider
the constitution of females, while they are in a state of innocence;
and when we have taken a view of the fortifications which nature has
made to preserve their chastity, we shall find out the reason why it
is so often surrendered, and be the better able to provide for its
defence.

Every woman, who is capable of conception, must have those parts
which officiate so framed, that they may be able to perform whatever
is necessary at that juncture. Now, to have those parts so rightly
adapted for the use which nature designed them, it is requisite that
they should have a very quick sensation, and, upon the application
of the male organ, afford the woman an exquisite pleasure; for
without this extravagant pleasure in fruition, the recipient organs
could never exert themselves to promote conception as they now do,
in such an extraordinary manner: the whole vagina, as one continued
sphincter, contracting and embracing the penis, while the nymphæ<20>
and adjacent islands have their particular emissions at that
critical minute, either as a vehicle to lubricate the passage, or
else to incorporate with the masculine injection: add to this, that
the fallopian tubes put themselves in a proper posture to receive 
the impregnating fluid, and convey it, as is supposed, to the
ovaria. Now it is hard to imagine, that so many alert members, which
can exert themselves in such a lively manner on this occasion,
should be at all other times in a state of perfect tranquillity;
for, besides that experience teaches us the contrary, this handsome
disposition would be entirely useless, if nature had not provided a
prior titillation, to provoke women at first to enter upon action;
and all our late discoveries, in anatomy, can find out no other use
for the clitoris, but to whet the female desire by its frequent
erections; which are, doubtless, as provoking as those of the penis,
of which it is a perfect copy, though in miniature.

In short, there requires no more to convince us of the violence of
female desire, when raised to a proper height, but only to consider,
what a terrible risk a woman runs to gratify it. Shame and poverty
are looked upon as trifles, when they come in competition with this
predominating passion. But although it must be allowed, that all
women are liable to these amorous desires, yet, the variety of
constitutions will make a considerable difference; for as in some
men the olfactory, auditory, or optic nerves, are not so brisk and
lively as in others, so there are some women who have the nerves of
their pudenda more lively, and endowed with a much quicker sensation
than others. Now, whether this difference is owing to the formation
of the nerves, or to the different velocity of the blood circulating
through those parts, or whether it is owing to the different
quantity, or perhaps acrimony, of that fluid which is separated from
the blood by the nymphæ, and other titillating glands: I say, from
whencesoever this difference proceeds, according to the degree of
this sensation, we may venture to pronounce a woman more or less in
their own nature chaste.

To counterbalance this violent natural desire, all young women have
strong notions of honour carefully inculcated into them from their
infancy. Young girls are taught to hate a whore, before they know
what the word means; and when they grow up, they find their worldly
interest entirely depending upon the reputation of their chastity.
This sense of honour and interest, is what we may call artificial
chastity; and it is upon this compound of natural and artificial
chastity, that every woman's real actual chastity depends.

As for instance, some women are naturally more chaste, or rather, to
speak properly, less amorous than others, and at the same time have
strict notions of honour. Such women are almost impregnable, and may
be compared to towns strongly fortified both by art and nature,
which, without treachery, are safe from any sudden attacks, and must
be reduced by long and regular sieges, such as few men have the
patience or resolution to go through with.

Other women, again, have the same value for their reputation, and
stand as much upon the point of honour; but then they are naturally
of a very sanguine amorous disposition. A woman of this class may
not unjustly be compared to a town well garrisoned, but whose
mutinous unruly inhabitants are strongly inclined to revolt and let
in the enemy. Such women, it's true, by extraordinary care and
vigilance may suppress these mutinies; and honour may for a long
while keep inclination under, but yet they are never perfectly safe;
there are certain times and seasons, certain unguarded hours, when
honour and interest are lulled asleep, and love has got the entire
ascendant. Besides, although we allow love and honour to be pretty
equal combatants, nay even granting, that in a pitched battle, when
they have mustered up all their forces, honour will have the
advantage, and quell inclination; yet, in the course of a long civil
war, it is odds but love one time or other obtains a victory, which
is sure to be decisive: for inclination has this unlucky advantage
over honour, that, instead of being weakened, it grows stronger by
subjection; and, like camomile, the more it is pressed down and kept
under, the sturdier it grows; or, like Antæus<21>, it receives fresh
vigour from every defeat, and rises the brisker the oftener it is
thrown. Whereas honour once routed never rallies; nay, the least
breach in female reputation is irreparable; and a gap in chastity,
like a chasm in a young tree, is every day a widening. Besides,
honour and interest require a long chain of solid reasoning before
they can be set in battle-array; whereas inclination is presently
under arms, the moment love has pitched his standard: for, as we
find that the least wanton glance of a lady's eye quickly alarms a
man's animal spirits, and puts the whole body corporate into an
unruly ferment; so, doubtless, the female imagination is at least
equally alert: and in such a sudden scuffle betwixt love and honour,
it is ten to one but the enemy enters; for the gate of chastity,
like the temple of Janus<22>, always stands open during these
conflicts. It must indeed be granted, that if the loss of honour was
immediately to succeed the loss of chastity, the virtue of these
women would be much stronger than it is; but they flatter themselves
with the hopes of secrecy, and fancy that they have found out an
expedient to purchase pleasure without the expense of reputation; by
this means honour is reconciled to inclination, or at best made to
stand neuter; and then the consequence is very obvious. In short, a
wanton woman of honour may withstand a great many attacks, and
possibly defend her chastity to the very last; but yet she is every
day in danger of being surprised, and at best will make but a very
precarious defence.

A third sort of women, the very reverse of the preceding, have
neither honour nor inclination; that is to say, they have neither
the one nor the other to an equal degree with the rest of the sex.
These kind of women who put a slighter value than ordinary upon
their characters, are generally, in their circumstances, either
above the world or below it; for when a woman has her interest and
fortune depending upon her reputation, as all the middle rank of
womankind have, she is a woman of honour of course. Interest, indeed
is inseparable from female honour, nay, it is the very foundation of
it; and honour and interest, when they are considered as guardians
to chastity, are synonymous terms. The bare point of honour, when
abstracted from interest, would prove but a small rub to women in
their eager pursuit of pleasure: thus we see the conduct of a maiden
lady, how much more circumspect it is whilst her fortune in marriage
is depending, than afterwards, when that point of interest is
secured by a husband; for all married women are above the world, in
so far as they are out of the reach of any suspicions or surmises,
or even a probability of incontinence; and since they are not liable
to be detected by pregnancy, there's no other sort of conviction
able to prejudice them, but downright ocular demonstration: which
seems to be the reason why so many of them take such liberties, as
if they were of Falstaff's opinion, when he said, nothing but eyes
confutes me. Female honour, therefore, being so nearly allied and
closely annexed to worldly interest, we must confine this class of
women to two sorts: first, those whose fortunes are independent, and
above being influenced by the censure of the world; and, secondly,
those who are so far below the world, that they either escape its
censure, or else are incapable of being hurt by it. The first sort
lie under this disadvantage, that let their natural chastity be ever
so great, the smallest spark of desire is capable of being blown up
and raised to a considerable pitch; whereas, when a woman is once
arrived to maturity, that portion of honour which she has acquired,
is with difficulty preserved, and at best is incapable of any
improvement. The second sort are equally liable to have their
passions raised, however low they may be naturally, and besides lie
under this farther disadvantage, that though they can't promote
their interest by preserving their chastity, yet, if they have the
least spark of beauty, they will find their account sufficiently in
parting with it. The virtue, indeed, of this class of women, seems
chiefly to depend upon the degree of beauty which they stand
possessed of; for if they have charms sufficient to provoke young
men to be at any tolerable pains and cost, their chastity can never
hold out long, but must infallibly surrender.

The fourth and last kind of women we shall mention, are those who
have a very moderate share of honour, joined to a very amorous
constitution.

The virtue of these women is entirely defenceless; and, as soon as a
man has removed that little timorous coyness, which is natural to
young women in their first attempts, he may proceed with confidence,
and conclude the breach to be practicable; for whatever resistance
he meets with afterwards, will only enhance the pleasure of
conquest. Most women, indeed, let them be ever so fully resolved to
comply, make as great a show of resistance as they can conveniently
counterfeit; and this the sex would pass upon the world for a kind
of innate modesty: but it is very easily accounted for.

As soon as women have entertained any degree of love, they make it
their whole study to raise and maintain an equal degree of passion
in the men; and they are very sensible how far the bare appearance
of modesty will prevail to render them amiable. The pain they suffer
in smothering their desires, is fully recompensed by that secret
pleasure which a lover's eagerness gives them, because they esteem
it a proof both of the sincerity and violence of his passion. A
woman is not, without some reason, afraid, lest a man's love should
diminish after enjoyment, and would gladly bribe his after-love, by
the great value she seems to put upon her chastity before she makes
him a present of it.

Besides, not to mention the actual pleasure a woman receives in
struggling, it is a justification of her in the eye of the man, and
a kind of salvo to her honour and conscience, that she never did
fully comply, but was in a manner forced into it. This is the plain
natural reason why most women refuse to surrender upon treaty, and
why they delight so much in being stormed.

Having thus taken a cursory view of the sex, in their several
classes, and according to their several circumstances, we may
conclude, preferring truth to complaisance, that by far the greater
part of womenkind hold their virtue very precariously; and that
female chastity is, in its own nature, built upon a very ticklish
foundation.

Hudibras has ludicrously placed the seat of male honour in the
posteriors, whereby it is secured from any attack in front; but
female honour, notwithstanding the apparent safety of the situation,
like a debtor's house upon the verge of two counties, is liable to
be attacked both ways; a parte ante, & a parte post.

That the seat of honour in females has this double aspect, like
Janus Bifrons<22>, and consequently that it is two ways accessible,
has already been taken notice of by almost all the writers upon this
subject; but it is worth remarking here, that Lycurgus<23> had an
eye to it when he modelled the Spartan petticoat; for though the
warmth of the climate obliged the women to be very open in that part
of their dress, insomuch that, if we believe Plutarch in his
comparison of Numa<24> and Lycurgus, the habit which the maidens of
Laconia<25> wore came but to their knees, and was open on both
sides, so that as they walked their thighs appeared bare; yet this
wise lawgiver would not permit them to make the least aperture,
either in the fore or hind part of that garment; rightly judging,
that those two sacred avenues to a maid's honour ought to be guarded
with the utmost caution.

For this same reason the upright posture of the body has always been
esteemed the most decent; and it has ever been the mode, in all
countries, for ladies to curtsey instead of bowing: for though a
female bow might seem a modest and coy reclension of the body, with
regard to the person saluted, yet it would occasion a very indecent
projection to those who should happen to be behind; especially since
that dangerous fashion of postern plackets has crept into the
European petticoat.

But to return to our present argument, the design of which was to
prove the following syllogism.

The only way to preserve female chastity, is to prevent the men from
laying siege to it: but this project of the public stews is the only
way to prevent men's laying siege to it: therefore this project is
the only way to preserve female chastity.

The former part of the proposition is, I hope, sufficiently proved.
It is, indeed, evident, from the bare consideration of the nature of
females, that if the men are suffered to go on, as they now do, in
the pursuit of pleasure, there is no possible way can be found out,
effectually, to secure the virtue of any one woman of any rank, or
in any station of life. If a woman is handsome, she has the more
trials to undergo, if homely, and for that reason seldom attacked,
the novelty of the address makes the greater impression: if she is
married, it is odds but there's a failure at home, and habitual
pleasures are not easily foregone, especially when they may be
enjoyed with safety: if a maid, her unexperienced virgin heart is
capable of any impression: if she is rich, ease and luxury make the
blood run mad; and love, if high-dieted, is ungovernable: if poor,
she will be the easier bribed, when love and avarice jointly must be
gratified.

In short, to sum up all, there is in the passion of love a certain
fatal crisis, to which all womenkind are capable of being wrought
up: the difference of virtue consisting only in this, that it is
very hard to work a virtuous woman up to this crisis, and requires a
very unlucky concurrence of circumstances: whereas a woman without a
good stock of virtue, must have an unaccountable series of good
fortune if she escapes. But, virtuous or not virtuous, when this
passion is once raised to the critical height, it is absolutely
irresistible.

Since therefore female virtue cannot effectually be secured, but by
preventing the men from laying siege to it, it remains for us to
examine, if this prevention can be effected by any other method than
that of erecting the public stews; and whether or no the public
stews, when erected, will have the desired effect.

That young men, in a good state of health, have their desires
towards women much stronger, and more violent, than for the
enjoyment of anything else in this life, is a truth not to be
contested. And it is likewise as certain, that young men will
gratify these desires, unless the legislature can affix such a
penalty to the commission of the fact, that the apprehension of the
penalty may give their minds more uneasiness, than refraining from
the gratification.

Now there are but three things which men fear in this life, viz.
shame, poverty, and bodily pain, and consequently but three sorts of
punishments which the legislature can inflict. The first of these,
indeed, might be omitted; for shame is so very little in the power
of the laws, that it hardly deserves the name of a penalty. If the
pillory, and such like infamous punishments, are more terrible for
the shame that attends them, than for the bodily pain, it is not
because such a posture of a man's body, with his neck through a
hole, is in itself ignominious, or that any law can make it so; but
because it publishes to the world, that a man has been proved to
commit such a certain action, in its own nature scandalous, which he
is ashamed to have thus publicly made known. The truth is, honour
and dishonour being only the different opinions of mankind, as to
the good or evil of any action; and these opinions in the mind
arising, as Dr. Clke<28> well observes, from the natural fitness
or unfitness of the actions themselves, cannot be altered or
determined by any secular force. And that they are entirely out of
the power of the legislature, is evident in the instance of
duelling; where a man often receives honour for a breach of the law,
nay is forced to break it in defence of his honour.

 The utmost scandal, therefore, which the laws can affix to any
action, is to make a full and open publication of the fact: now it
is evident that this publication cannot have a sufficient influence
over men's minds to deter them from wenching, a crime which meets
with so favourable a reception in the eye of the world, that young
men are not ashamed to boast of it.

We must have recourse then to a fine, or corporal punishment, or
perhaps both. If it is a fine, it must be one of these three sorts;
either a certain determinate sum for every offence, or, to make it
fall more equally, such a certain portion of a man's whole
substance, or else it must be such a sum as the jury shall think
sufficient to repair the woman's damages. The first is impracticable
because of its inequality, with regard to men's different fortunes.
The second would punish none but men of fortune. And the third, in
many cases, would be impossible; for women are often ruined by such
as have it not in their power to make them amends. But granting that
a fine could be so happily contrived as to affect all men equally in
their several stations of life; and let us suppose this fine
considerable enough, for so it must be, to deter any moderate-
spirited man: yet still we lie under a manifest dilemma as to the
point of proof; for if the proof is to depend upon the evidence of
eye-witnesses, none but fools will be convicted; and let a man be
ever so indiscreet, he that swears to rem in re<29> must have good
eyes, and be a good swearer withal. If, on the other hand, a man is
to be convicted upon the sole evidence of the woman, we run into
greater inconveniencies: for either a woman is to be recompensed for
the injury she has received, or not; if not, there is no modest
woman of common sense, but will choose much rather to conceal her
weakness, than expose it in public court so much to her own
prejudice; and this too upon the sole motive of doing prejudice to a
man, for whom, in all probability, she still retains an affection:
so that no man would be accused but by such sort of women as the law
can never intend to favour or countenance.

And if the woman is to receive this fine, either in part or the
whole, by way of reparation, not to mention its being an actual
encouragement to transgress, this recompense would only be a means
to promote a multitude of false accusations; for what man could live
with so much circumspection, that a woman might not often have an
opportunity to accuse him of such a fact, with very probable
circumstances, when there is no opportunity of detecting the
fallacy. This difficulty, indeed, is not to be got over; and the
objection lies equally strong against all sorts of corporal
punishment, death itself not excepted. For if there are so many
false indictments for rapes, where a woman receives no benefit by
the prosecution, where she is liable to such cross examinations, and
where the possibility of the fact is so much doubted, that a woman
is generally discountenanced, and must bring a number of probable
concurrent circumstances before she can gain credit: I say, if
notwithstanding these discouragements, there are so many malicious
prosecutions for rapes, that the benefit of the law in general is
much disputed, what may we expect in the present case, where a woman
has nothing to do but acknowledge that she was over-persuaded, and
then all difficulties vanish? Besides, if such a law was made,
setting aside that the remedy would be worse than the disease, it is
much to be questioned if it proved any remedy at all: for what fine
can we propose as sufficient to deter men, when there are so many
that squander away their whole fortunes upon this sole
gratification? And what corporal punishment, on this side death, can
we find out equivalent to a pox, which they every day run the risk
of?

 But no such law, as yet, has been so much as proposed, although
whoring has been a very obvious mischief ever since laws were in
being; therefore, without farther argument, considering the wisdom
of our legislature, that such a law never has been made, ought to be
sufficient reason for us to judge it impracticable.

Since the torrent of lewdness, then, is too strong to be opposed by
open force, let us see if we can find out an expedient to divert it
by policy, and prevent the mischief though we can't prevent the
crime.

Most authors, who have writ of government, have chosen to express
their sentiments by comparing the public body with the body natural;
and Mr. Hobbes, in his Leviathan, has carried the allegory as far as
it will go. To make use of it in the present instance, we may look
upon whoring as a kind of peccant humour in the body politic, which,
in order to its discharge, naturally seizes upon such external
members as are most liable to infection, and at the same time most
proper to carry off the malignity. If this discharge is promoted by
a licence for public stews, which is a kind of legal evacuative, the
constitution will certainly be preserved: whereas, if we apply penal
laws, like violent astringents, they will only drive the disease
back into the blood; where, gathering strength, and at last
assimilating the whole mass, it will break out with the utmost
virulence, to the apparent hazard of those sound members, which
otherwise might have escaped the contagion. As we may observe in a
clap, where nature of her own accord expels the noxious humour
through the same passages by which it was at first received; but if
we resist nature in this discharge, and repel the venom by too hasty
an application of styptics, the disease then turns to a pox, seizes
the vitals, and, to use Solomon's words like a dart, strikes through
the liver<30>. But, leaving allegory as more proper for rhetoric or
poetry, than such serious debates, since this project of the public
stews is the only expedient now left for the preservation of female
chastity, the question is, whether or no this expedient will really
answer the end proposed?

To prove the affirmative, requires no more but that we look into
ourselves, and examine our own passions; for love ever was and will
be the same in all men, and in all ages. The first amorous emotions
that young men feel, are violent; they are plagued with a
stimulation, which raises a vehement desire: the passion is strong,
but then it is general; it is lust, not love: and therefore the
natural impatience of lust will prompt them to take the speediest
way for present gratification, and make them prefer the ready and
willing embraces of a courtesan, before the doubtful and distant
prospect of enjoying a modest damsel, whose coyness will cost so
much pains, as well as time, to overcome; and, when overcome, may
probably occasion a future uneasiness, and give them more trouble
after enjoyment than they had before.

Besides this, if their first affections should happen to be engaged
to a particular object, which is very rare; and that this particular
object was in their power to compass, which is still rarer; yet
there is naturally in young men a certain secret shame, which
attends their first sallies, and prevents their declaring a private
passion, 'till it grows so violent, that they are forced to give it
vent upon the public; and by that means, get into a regular method
of making themselves easy, without doing their modesty any violence.

But though the natural bent of men's minds inclines them to an easy
purchase of pleasure in their first amours, yet public whoring lies
at present under so many disadvantages; the public women, for want
of good regulation, are so infamous in the principles and practice;
the places of resort so vile, and so scandalously imposing in the
common expense, and lying under the lash of the civil power, so
pestered with the mercenary officiousness of reforming constables;
and which is worst of all, the plague of claps and poxes is so
inevitable, that men contrary to their inclinations are often forced
to enter upon private intrigues, either without trying the public,
or after meeting with some misfortunes in the trial.

Now if we see daily so many young men who prefer the public commerce
under all these disadvantages, what success may we not expect from
this happy establishment of the stews, when the young women's
behaviour will be regulated after a civil decent manner; when the
houses of entertainment will be so commodious, and the expense of
accommodation so reasonable; when the horrid dread of claps is
entirely removed; and when the laws, instead of disturbing such
assemblies, will be employed in their protection, to give them the
greater countenance and encouragement; surely we may hope for a
thorough reformation.

But if these considerations should not prove fully effectual, and
some men should be so obstinate as to persist in private whoring,
notwithstanding these inducements to the contrary; we must then have
recourse to legal force, and drive those who are too restive to be
led: for though the laws can't prevent whoring, they may yet
regulate it; the quid is not in their power, but the quomodo is<31>.
A man must eat, but he may be directed how to eat. The strongest
curb can't stop an unruly horse, but the weakest will serve to turn
him: and the smallest stream is not to be obstructed, though we can
change the course of the greatest river. So love, though ever so
unruly and headstrong in the general, changes the particular object
of its passion with the smallest circumstance; and legal penalties
are no trifling dissuasives, when the laws don't command
impossibilities.

This argument indeed, of compulsion, is in a manner supernumerary,
and thrown in, as it were, ex abundanti<32>: for the public stews
under this regular economy, will have so much the advantage of
private whoring, whether we regard the ease and convenience of
enjoyment, or the beauty and variety of mistresses, that men's
natural inclinations will sway them sufficiently without this
superfluous constraint. If there is any fear of success, the danger
lies on the other side; and indeed we have some colour of reason to
apprehend, lest the whole body of lewdness being turned upon the
public, there should want a sufficient supply of young women to
recruit the stews; which, by that means may run into a sudden
disrepute, and lose a character that will be difficult to retrieve.
But however plausible this objection may seem at first sight, we
shall find, upon a nearer view, that it only serves to make the
excellence of this scheme the more manifest.

As there is constantly in the nation, a certain number of young men,
whose passions are too strong to brook any opposition: our business
is to contrive a method how they may be gratified, with as little
expense of female virtue as possible. But the difficulty lies in
adjusting this matter, and gauging our young men's affections so
exactly, that the modesty of one woman may not be sacrificed, more
than is absolutely necessary for the preservation of the rest.

The gallants of this age, indeed, are not quite so sturdy as that
rampant Roman emperor who deflowered ten Sarmatian virgins in one
night<33>; but what we want in constitution, we make up in the
nicety of our palates; as a squeamish stomach requires the greatest
variety of dishes: and some of our youth are grown such perfect 
epicures in venery, that they can relish nothing but virgins: they
destroy, it is true, a great deal of beauty, by browsing only upon
the buds.

But we ought not to judge of these men's abilities by the number of
women they debauch, no more than we should measure the goodness of a
certain curious gentleman's appetite by his bespeaking several dozen
of young pigeons, when he only regaled upon the rumps: neither is it
entirely from a wantonness of fancy, or a luxurious taste of
pleasure, that men indulge themselves in making this havoc, but
chiefly for their own personal safety. Young girls are so giddy,
thoughtless, and unexperienced, and withal so fond of the sport, at
their first setting out, that they seldom escape a taint; and a man
is not safe in being constant: nay, some men are afraid of venturing
even after themselves. By this means several likely women, that
might do the public signal service, are in a short time rendered
useless: and, by a modest computation, we are put to the expense of
as many virtuous women in one year, as might reasonably serve the
nation six.

Now, the public stews will regulate this affair so precisely, and
with such critical exactness, that one year with another, we shall
not have one woman employed in the public service more than is
absolutely necessary, nor one less than is fully sufficient.

When this project is first set on foot, the vast choice and variety
there is at present of these women, will give us an opportunity of
making a very beautiful collection; and will, doubtless, for some
time, occasion a considerable run upon the public; so that private
whoring, the only nursery of our courtesans, may probably remain too
long neglected: for the whole body of our incontinent youth, like a
standing army, being employed in constant action, there cannot well
be spared a sufficient detachment to raise the necessary recruits.

But however true this may be, we shall thereby suffer no
inconvenience; for if the supplies of young women, which we may
reasonably expect from the northern and western parts of these
kingdoms, or from such places as are remote and out of the influence
of this scheme: I say, if these supplies should not prove sufficient
to answer the greatness of the demand, and that the reputation of
the stews upon this account, should begin to flag, why then the
worst accident that can befall, is a gradual relapse into our former
state of private whoring; and this no farther than is just necessary
to recruit the stews, and thereby make them retrieve their former
character: for every woman that is debauched more than is barely
necessary, only brings so much additional credit and reputation to
the stews, and in some measure atones for the loss of her own
chastity, by being a means to preserve that of others; so that
whenever the tide of private lewdness runs too high, and exceeds the
just and ordinary bounds, it must of course, by encouraging the
public stews, immediately suffer a proportionable ebb: that is to
say, it must be reduced again so low, that there will remain but
just a sufficient quantity to supply the stews: which is as low, as
in the nature of the thing is possible.

I might here lavish out encomiums, and take occasion to dwell upon
those many advantages that will accrue to the nation by this
admirable scheme; but shall only take notice of this peculiar
excellence, which it has above all other schemes, that it
necessarily executes itself.

But since the necessity of debauching a certain number of young
women, is entirely owing to the necessity of supplying the public
stews; a question may very reasonably arise, whether this project
might not be vastly improved, even to the total extirpation of
private whoring, by an act for encouraging the importation of
foreign women. This, I must confess, deserves a serious debate: for,
besides the honour of our females, which would be preserved by such
an act, it might bring this farther advantage; that whereas most of
our estated youth spend a great part of their time and fortunes in
travelling abroad, for no other end, as it seems by most of them,
but to be informed in the French and Italian gallantry; they would
then have an opportunity of satisfying their curiosity in foreign
amours, without stirring out of London. But I shall leave the
decision of this matter to abler pens, well knowing, that a truth of
this nature, which carries so much the air of novelty, will require
much better authority than mine to warrant it.

Let it suffice for the present, that I have fully proved what I at
first proposed in this treatise: that public whoring is neither so
criminal in itself, nor so detrimental to the society, as private
whoring; and that the encouraging of public whoring, by erecting
stews for that purpose, will not only prevent most of the
mischievous consequences of this vice, but even lessen the quantity
of whoring in general, and reduce it to the narrowest bounds which
it can possibly be contained in.

After what has been said, it may, perhaps, appear somewhat odd to
talk of religious objections, as if either Christianity or morality
could possibly object against a scheme, which is entirely calculated
for the welfare and happiness of mankind. But since a great many men
amongst us have entertained such whimsical notions of religion, as
to imagine, that in some cases, a law may be unjust and wicked,
though it evidently promotes the public good; as if the right
enjoyment of this life was inconsistent with our happiness in the
next: I say, since many men of understanding have suffered
themselves to be possessed with this mistaken principle, I shall, as
briefly as may be, answer such objections as can, with any colour of
reason, be offered.

First then, I expect to be attacked with that old moral precept, of
not doing evil that good may come of it. This may be answered with
another old saying, equally authentic, and more applicable to the
present purpose, that of two evils we ought to choose the least. The
case is this: a private member of a society, may, doubtless, commit
a crime with a design to promote the good of that society, which was
partly the case of Felton against the Duke of Buckingham<34>; and
this evil action may possibly answer the goodness of the intention,
but is universally condemned as an unwarrantable presumption; and
falls justly under the censure of doing a certain evil, for the
prospect of an uncertain good. But as to the legislature, there is a
wide difference; for they, and they only, are entrusted with the
welfare of the society: this public welfare is, or ought to be, the
whole end and scope of their actions; and they are fully empowered
to do whatever they judge conducive to that end. If their intentions
come up to this, they are certainly in their consciences acquitted:
but as to the world, their actions, that is, their laws, are judged
good or bad, just or unjust, according as they actually prove
beneficial or detrimental to the society in general: and therefore
it is the grossest absurdity, and a perfect contradiction in terms,
to assert, that a government may not commit evil that good may come
of it; for, if a public act, taking in all its consequences, really
produces a greater quantity of good, it must, and ought to be termed
a good act; although the bare act, considered in itself, without the
consequent good, should be in the highest degree wicked and unjust.

As for instance: a ship performing quarantine, and known to be
infected, is sunk by a storm; some of the crew, half drowned,
recover the shore; but the moment they land, the government orders
them to be shot to death; this action, in itself, is no less than a
downright unchristian and inhuman murder: but since the health and
safety of the nation is secured by this severe precaution, it is no
wonder, if we allow the action to be not only justifiable, but in
the strictest sense of morality, just.

Another objection, or rather the same set in a stronger light, is,
that although the welfare and happiness of the community is, or
ought to be, the only end of all law and government, yet since our
spiritual welfare is the summum bonum<35> which all Christians
should aim at, no Christian government ought to authorize the
commission of the least known sin, though for the greatest temporal
advantage.

To this objection, I answer, that it is universally allowed as one
of the greatest perfections of the Christian religion, that its
precepts are calculated to promote the happiness of mankind in this
world as well as the next; if so, then it is a direct arraignment of
the Lawgiver's infinite wisdom, i.e. a contradiction, to assert that
in matters of law and government, the public breach of any gospel
precept can possibly be for the temporal good of any society
whatever: and therefore we may with confidence affirm, that no
sinful laws can be beneficial, and vice versa, that no beneficial
laws can be sinful. Now we have already given sufficient proof of
the benefit the public would receive by licensing the stews, and
therefore ought to conclude such licence lawful; but lest the
apparent wickedness of the stews, should be objected against this
general reasoning, it is fit that we examine this matter a little
nearer.

Fornication is, no doubt, a direct breach of a gospel precept, and
is therefore a sin; but this sin, barely as such, concerns the
government no more than the eating of black-puddings, equally
prohibited in the same text.<36> The reason is this: the sin
consists in a full intention to gratify a lustful desire; which
intention the legislature cannot possibly prevent: penalties indeed
may deter men from gratifying their desires, at the expense of the
public, but will rather increase than lessen the desires themselves.
If it is argued, that the sin of the intention is aggravated by
being put in execution, so much the better for our purpose; for then
the argument stands thus.

Since the sin of the intention is entirely out of the legislature's
power, the utmost they can do, with regard to this sin, is, to
prevent its being aggravated by actual commission.

 But the public stews, as we have already proved, will prevent as
much as possible this actual commission.

Therefore the public stews will prevent as much as possible this
sin.

Another branch of this objection, without which the objection itself
would be of no force, is, that the authorizing of public stews is a
public encouragement for people to whore.

If by people are meant those in the stews, I hope it will be thought
no crime to encourage such people, rather to confine themselves to
the practice of one vice, than live by committing a thousand;
especially when that one vice is what they would really practice,
whether they were encouraged or not.

But if any imagine that this particular licence would be a general
encouragement to the whole nation, they are certainly mistaken. For,
as to the men, they are already as bad as they can be; if anything
cures them, it must be satiety; let them have full and free leave to
take a surfeit of unlawful love, and they will soon learn to prefer
the chaste embraces of innocence before the bought smile of harlots
loveless, joyless, unendeared, casual fruition.

It is a right observation, that restraint does but whet a man's
passions instead of curing them.exuperat magis, ægrescitque
medendo. Æn.12.<37> And a late ingenious author, who studied
mankind, speaking on the subject, has these words: "To put down
public stews, is not only to disperse fornication into all parts,
but, by the difficulty, to excite wild and wanton people to this
vice."<38>

It was observed at Rome, that in the full liberty of divorces, there
was not a single instance of one in fifty years: and that Cato
longed for his wife again as soon as she was in another's
possession.

The master of love says positively, Quod licet ingratum est, quod
non licet acrius urit.<39> And Martial speaking to a married rake,
B.3. Ep.68. says,

Cur aliena placet tibi, quæ tua non placet uxor?
Nunquid securus non potes arrigere?

I prithee tell me why a wife
Thy am'rous fancy never warms?
What! Without danger o'thy life,
Cannot thy cod-piece stand to arms?

And again, B.1 . Ep. 74.

Nullus in urbe fuit tota, qui tangere vellet
Uxorem gratis, Caeciliane tuam
Dum licuit: sed nunc, positis custodibus, ingens
Turba fututorum est. Ingeniosus homo es.

There's no man, Cecil, in the town,
Would, gratis, have enjoyed thy spouse;
But now thou are so jealous grown,
Lord! What a crowd about the house!
You've locked her up, t'increase her value:
In short, you are a cunning fellow.

The public stews will not encourage men to be lewd, but they will
encourage them to exercise their lewdness in a proper place, without
disturbing the peace of the society, and with as little detriment to
themselves as possible. And, as to the women, there's not the least
shadow of encouragement: for no modest woman ever lost her maiden-
head with the dismal prospect of becoming a public courtesan: and if
a woman is not modest, the licensing of the public stews is no more
an encouragement for her to practise, than the allowing a certain
number of hackney-coaches every Sunday is an encouragement for the
rest to ply; when the very licence, to some, expressly implies a
prohibition of the rest.

Having now sufficiently proved the institution of the public stews
to be a political good, and answered all the religious objections
against it; I shall conclude with observing, that I have the
authority of Italy, the most politic nation in the world, to back me
in the first part of my argument; and the opinion of Holland, one of
the strictest reformed churches, to vindicate me in the second; and
that we ourselves enjoyed the benefit of this institution till we
were deprived of it by the over-hasty zeal of our first reformers in
the sixteenth century.

The public stews were anciently kept in Southwark, if not by an
express licence from the government, at least by an open permission;
though we have most reason to believe the first, since they paid
regular taxes both to the lord-mayor of the city, and to the bishop
of the see.

 We do not find that they were ever molested till the 25th of Edward
the Third[1352], when, in the parliament at Westminster, at the
request of the Londoners, says Daniel<40>, an act passed, obliging
all common whores to distinguish themselves, by wearing hoods
striped with divers colours, or furs, and their gowns turned inside
out.

This, indeed, was but a trifle to what they suffered thirty years
after by Wat Tyler's rebellion.

In the fifth of Richard the Second[1381], Wat marched up from
Dartmouth, with a true spirit of reformation, fully resolved to burn
and destroy everything that opposed him: if the archbishop's palace
at Lambeth could not escape, there was little mercy to be expected
for the stews; besides, whoring was not the least of Wat's
grievances: he began his rebellion by killing a collector of the
poll-tax for being a little too brisk upon his daughter; and his
antipathy to the stews was still increased, by the Lord Mayor's
shutting the city-gates, and denying him entrance; for he could not
revenge the affront more effectually, than by cutting off so large a
branch of his lordship's revenue.

In short, everything concurred to the destruction of the stews, and
demolished they were.

 This action, however, lost Tyler his life; for William Walworth,
the then Lord Mayor, was the very man that struck him first off his
horse in Smithfield: for which the king knighted him, gave him a
hundred pounds pension, and added the dagger to the city arms.

Whilst whoring was in this unsettled condition, the bishop thought
it a good opportunity to engross the whole profit of licensing
courtesans, which occasioned them fresh trouble; for John
Northampton, who succeeded Walworth, either piqued at the bishop's
invading his right, or out of a real reforming principle, for he was
a follower of Wycliffe, commenced a severe persecution. He had his
spies and constables in every street, to apprehend strollers; and
such women as were neither handsome nor rich enough to bribe his
officers, were carried through the streets in great pomp, with their
hair shorn, and trumpets and pipes playing before them. All this he
did contrary to the express commands of the bishop, who had several
bickerings with him upon that head.

This great reformer John Northampton was, from his troublesome
temper, nick-named Cumber-Town; and as he succeeded Tyler in the
work of reformation, so he had like to have met with as bad a fate:
for two years after he was found guilty of high-treason, without
making the least defence; had his goods confiscated, and was
condemned to perpetual imprisonment a hundred miles from London:
accordingly he was sent to Tintagel Castle in Cornwall.

This dreadful Cumber-Town being removed, the stews had leisure to
re-settle themselves under the protection of the church; and enjoyed
an almost uninterrupted tranquillity for an hundred and fifty years.

We find, indeed, an act passed at Westminster, in the 11th of Henry
the Sixth, that no keepers of stews, or whore-houses, in Southwark
should be empanelled upon any jury, or keep a tavern in any other
place.

But the most sensible blow they ever felt, was the invasion of the
French-pox. The Spaniards had brought it from the islands of Florida
to Naples, and the army of Charles the Eighth, when he conquered
that Kingdom in the year 1495, transmitted it into France, from
whence it had a very quick passage into England; for there was an
act passed in the latter end of Henry the Seventh's reign, for
expelling out of the stews all such women as had the faculty of
burning men. However, we find they still continued in good repute in
the reign of Henry the Eighth, and yielded a considerable revenue to
the Bishop of London; for Bucer, in one of his books against
Gardiner, taxes him with it as an heinous crime, that he should
receive most of his rents out of the public stews.

After this terrible accusation, we may easily guess what quarter our
stews met with at the reformation. But now Bucer has got his ends;
the stews are destroyed; those public nuisances are demolished;
whoring is attacked on all hands without mercy; and what then? Why,
truly, by mere dint of reforming, we have reduced lewdness to that
pass, that hardly one bachelor in the kingdom will lie with a woman,
if he is sure that she's not sound; and very few modest women will
suffer a man to get them with child, unless he makes a promise to
marry. In short, the truth is, we are at this present writing as bad
as we can be; and I hope I have fairly shown how we may be better.
